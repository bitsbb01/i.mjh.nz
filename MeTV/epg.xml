    <sub-title>Brideless Groom***, Fuelin' Around, Scrambled Brains, Three Hams On Rye, Gents In A Jam, Outer Space Jitters</sub-title>
    <desc>"To inherit a fortune, voice teacher Shemp must marry before six o'clock, but no girl will accept his proposal.  Finally one of his repulsive students agrees to marry him, just in the nick of time.  When the rest of the prospective brides hear about the inheritance, they show up at the ceremony and a free for all ensues.  Shemp marries before the deadline, but wishes he was still a free man.
, The Stooges are carpet layers working in the home of a scientist, Professor Sneed, who has invented a super rocket fuel.  Larry is mistaken for the professor by foreign agents who kidnap the trio and take them to the country of Anemia where they are ordered to produce the rocket fuel or be executed.  The boys come up with a concoction they try to pass of as the real stuff, but are exposed when the real professor and his daughter are also kidnapped.  The Stooges help them escape, using their secret formula to fuel a jeep.
, The Stooges accompany professor Jones on an expedition to Venus, where they discover that the Venusians are planning to conquer the earth with an army of zombies.  When the boys learn that they're going to be turned into zombies, they escape.  The scene changes to the Stooges apartment where we learn they are just telling a bedtime story to their kids (also played by the Stooges) while they wait for the baby sitter to arrive.  When the baby sitter shows up, she looks like one of the zombies and the boys exit in a hurry.
, Shemp is a sick man, suffering from hallucinations.  His worst vision is that his ugly nurse Nora is actually beautiful.  When Moe and Larry come to take him home from the sanitarium, they discover he's become engaged to Nora.  On the way to Nora's apartment for the wedding, the boys get in a fight with a stranger who promises to get even with them if he ever sees them again.  They arrive to finding Nora waiting for her father, who, when he arrives, turns out to be the man they just fought with.
, The Stooges are stagehands who also have small parts in a big play.  They quickly get on the bad side of the producer.  First they fail to prevent a famous critic from sneaking into the audience.  Then Shemp accidentally adds a potholder into a cake they bake as a prop.  During the play the Stooges (as southern gentlemen) and the rest of the cast spit up feathers during what was supposed to be a serious scene.  The critic thinks it's a hilarious satire and the boys are redeemed
, Shemp's rich Uncle Phineas comes to visit the Stooges who are broke and about to be evicted.  The boys convince their landlady Mrs. McGruder not to toss them out as Shemp is set to inherit a fortune.  The boys also have trouble with a circus strongman after Shemp accidentally rips off his wife's dress.  Uncle Phineas gets in the middle of the fight, and Mrs. McGruder ends it by knocking out the strongman.  It turns out that Uncle Phineas and the landlady were childhood sweethearts and he marries her, leaving the Stooges out of the bucks once again.
