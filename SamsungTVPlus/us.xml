    <title>A Fish Called Wanda</title>
    <desc>A stellar cast that includes John Cleese, Michael Palin, Kevin Kline (who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar® for his performance) and Jamie Lee Curtis highlight this outrageous farce. Four conniving jewel thieves...three Yorkshire terriers...two heaving bosoms and one proper barrister all collide when a girl called Wanda (Curtis) tries to deceive her Nietzsche-quoting boyfriend (Kline), an animal-loving hitman (Palin) and an embarrassment-prone counselor (Cleese) out of a fortune in jewels!</desc>

    <title>Road House</title>
    <desc>Dalton (Patrick Swayze) drives a Mercedes Benz, holds a degree in philosophy from NYU and makes lots of money. He's been shot at, stabbed and has broken most of the bones in his body. He also has a flip side - he's the best bar bouncer in the business. When Dalton's brought in to clean up a popular establishment that has become particularly rowdy, his calm is put to the test by the nasty local kingpin (Ben Gazzara) in this throwback to the great westerns of the 40s and 50s.</desc>

    <title>About Alex</title>
    <desc>'About Alex' is the story of seven college friends who reunite over a three-day weekend, after one of them attempts suicide. When the friends get together to keep an eye on Alex, the weekend that ensues will renew old crushes and resentments, shine light on bad decisions, and ultimately push friendships and relationships to the brink as the group tries to speculate when the simple life of their college years turned so muddy and complex. Sometimes irreverent, sometimes poetic, and always moving, About Alex is a searingly honest look at the changing nature of adult friendship in the Facebook/Twitter generation.</desc>

    <title>White Irish Drinkers</title>
    <desc>A coming of age story set in 1975 working-class Brooklyn, in which two teenage brothers living with their abusive father and their well-meaning but ineffective mother are caught up in a life of petty crime. Older brother Danny concocts a daring scheme to steal enough money for the two to escape, timed around the chaos of an upcoming Rolling Stones concert. The sensitive younger brother, Brian, ultimately has a choice: remain loyal to the brother with whom he shares a powerful love-hate bond, or use his hidden talent as an artist as his own ticket out of their dead-end existence.</desc>

    <title>The Island with Bear Grylls</title>
    <desc>''Episode 12'' -In this final episode, after five weeks on the island, the men are struggling to find enough to eat as the island's already depleted resources fail to deliver the coconuts and limpets that have become their staple diet. With energy levels at rock bottom, the island's oldest castaway - 58-year-old car salesman Phil - is forgotten when an unsatisfying watery fish broth is served for lunch. The oversight sees the men galvanize themselves to recapture their team spirit of old. The men decide that the only way to slow their physical decline is to put the last of their remaining energy into hunting for meat to eat. After a daring capture, the men feast on their first taste of meat in weeks, and their energy and spirits are revived. Finally, Bear Grylls arrives to bring the men back to civilization. In an emotional farewell, the men's last act is for web designer Kyle to finally extinguish the fire that he started 41 days ago.</desc>

    <title>The Sun: Inferno In The Sky</title>
    <desc>At first glance, our sun seems quiet - but it isn't. It's an incredibly dynamic place, a world of extremes...
On July 23rd, 2012, a massive eruption on the sun hurls a colossal cloud of solar matter into space. It's the most severe sunstorm in 150 years.
Fortunately, the Earth is not in the direct path of this solar ejection. But it's only a matter of time before a violent solar storm hits us. When these clouds of charged matter reach our planet, they can wreak havoc in electrical systems. Previous sunstorms have resulted in large-scale power outages and the total loss of satellites.
An important indicator for solar activity is sunspots - darker areas that are a little cooler than the rest of the sun's surface. Scientists at the Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory in Carinthia, Austria, monitor sunspots every day. They send their observations to the World Data Centre of the Sunspot Index in Bruxelles, where other experts are trying to predict the sun's behaviour so they can forecast space weather.
'The Sun - Inferno in the Sky', presents the latest developments in solar science and offers fresh, unexpected and even controversial insights into the work of scientists all around the world.</desc>

    <title>The Library</title>
    <desc>As we seek to honor and celebrate the countless LGBTQ individuals, communities, sub-communities, and dynasties that have flourished in the face of adversity over decades, it dawned on us that there are so many unknown and untold stories about gay history, vocabulary, vernacular, and the human experiences that fuel the formation of cultures and identities based on authentic self-expression and love. As we discovered these stories, we wished for a gay "library" where anyone could visit and learn, in bite-size portions, about crucial events in gay history, gay heroes and icons past and present, fascinating sub-cultures, slang terms, scientific references, political movements... Essentially, a record of all the bits of queer education that are at risk of being lost or misinterpreted — information that we all crave as members of LGBTQ communities and as Allies. Do you know the story of the first Pride parade? Ever wondered what "Skoliosexual," "Polycule," or "Doppelbanger" means? The Library is open — and ready to clue you in.</desc>

The Qualifier is comprised of some fiendish hurdles to cross, including the famous Big Red Balls and the Sucker Punch - both poised to send the contestants flying into pools of water and mud. Crash Mountain and Dizzy Dummies cut the line-up down even more before the final challenge awaits.</desc>

    <title>I'M LIVE: S1 E181</title>
    <desc>Joining us on this week's I'm LIVE is guitarist and singer-songwriter Jukjae! This artist initially made his reputation in the music scene as a session guitarist, composer, and arranger. Then in April 2014, he released a self-written song "View" through the compilation album, "bright #2," and his debut album, "One Word," in November, officially starting a singing career of his own. Thanks to his dexterity in playing guitar, he has played with a number of top musicians, including Park Hyo-shin, Kim Dong-ryul, IU and more. Last month in November, Jukjae released his second mini-album, "2006," the year Jukjae describes as “the most beautiful and innocent time” in his life. With the lead single, "Shining, My 2006," he hopes people will look back at the time they were at their brightest and happiest, to escape reality for a brief moment. In this episode, Jukjae performs "Shining, My 2006," "The Door," "Do You Want To Walk With Me?" "Let's Go See the Stars," and "View." Tune in to "I'm LIVE" and take a glimpse into his artistry!</desc>

Best friends Olivia, Andrea, Emma, Mia and Stephanie reside in HeartLake City but didn't know each other - that is until the World Petacular brought them together!

    <title>The Book Of Monsters, Part 2 - Episode 102</title>
    <desc>Realizing they must defend the Kingdom from Jestro's monsters, the Knights try to organize but are despondent when they discover their best advisor - Merlok the Magician - has sacrificed himself to save them.   When Jestro awakens, he's been blasted miles and miles away from the King's Castle by Merlok's explosive spell.  And, it seems, all the books he was trying to steal have been scattered, too.  The Book of Monsters broke Jestro' fall and now he can use the book to attack the people who laughed at him.  Meanwhile, the King and his newly-trained Knights pick through the rubble of Merlok's library.  They'll have to figure something out, because Jestro and his newly made magic monsters attack King's Castle!  Clay organizes the Knights to defend the kingdom, but they've never worked together before.  It takes all their training, plus the help of an old friend...MERLOK!  Only now he's MERLOK 2.0.  Ava has been piecing together what happened and discovering that the "ghost in the machine" she's been chasing is really Merlok in digital form.  Now, he can use his magic digitally and he downloads just the right weapons to the struggling Knights!  They finally foil Jestro's attack with Merlok's help and officially become NEXO KNIGHTS!</desc>

    <title>The Power Of Merlok - Episode 103</title>
    <desc>When Jestro attacks a village on the far side of the Kingdom, the NEXO-Knights wonder how they'll get there.  Then Macy remembers her dad has a royal RV...maybe they can "mod" that for their own, "knightly" use? Now the NEXO-Knights get rolling...in THE FORTREX, their own ROLLING CASTLE!  This great new HQ, which houses Merlok 2.0 as an operating system, will be how the knights move around Knighton and protect it from Jestro and his monsters.  Speaking of the evil jester, in this episode Jestro uses some newly-made monsters to attack a town far from the capitol where he thinks he's safe from the Knights' reach.  We see two parallel stories here: the Knights training, learning more about digital magic and getting organized as a team and at the same time we see Jestro making monsters, trying to learn how his powers work and talking to the Book.  In the end, the Knights roll up in their castle and defeat Jestro and his marauding monsters.  Lance thinks he should be the leader because he's a snot. "Of course I'm the leader...I'm a Richmond."</desc>

    <title>The Golden Castle - Episode 106</title>
    <desc>When Lance is cast as the star in the new remake of the classic movie "Ned Knightly and the Golden Castle" he doesn't anticipate Jestro and his monsters invading the set and ruining his starring role. It's movie time!  Lance does something very Lance: he agrees to star in a movie about remake of a classic film in Knighton: "The Golden Castle."  While pillaging a village, Jestro and the Book of Monsters see a movie poster for "The Golden Castle" and the book says the legendary Golden Castle is filled with riches!  Jestro explains that it's just a dumb movie and that it's not real.  It's all based on a "script."  The Book, who's been shelved for many years, wants to eat the movie script to learn more about the modern world.  On the set of the movie, Lance has invited the other Knights to act as extras.  When they see how Lance is being portrayed, they're incensed.  When Jestro attacks the movie set to get the script for his book to eat, the film director keeps rolling.  This battle footage is fantastic!  The Knights defeat Jestro even though the movie set is trashed.  The director will make it work.  At the premier of the movie, Lance is embarrassed to see that he's been reduced to comic relief for the realm's bravest Knight...Macy!  The director has now made her a star.</desc>

    <title>Europe's Largest Desert</title>
    <desc>Near the cold Pyrenees of Iberia, surrounded by ancient and dark green forests, there is an odd land where the rain is so scarce and the wind is always blowing. The soil is poor, there are no trees and the landscape has become very much like the moon. Is this what the future of desertification will look like?  

This strange landscape is home to incredible creatures with surprising behaviours. We'll discover a place with a very dry skin but a wet hidden heart that allows even aquatic birds or amphibians to live. Living in such conditions is not easy and it's only the toughest animals that will survive.</desc>

    <title>Europe's Largest Desert</title>
    <desc>Near the cold Pyrenees of Iberia, surrounded by ancient and dark green forests, there is an odd land where the rain is so scarce and the wind is always blowing. The soil is poor, there are no trees and the landscape has become very much like the moon. Is this what the future of desertification will look like?  

This strange landscape is home to incredible creatures with surprising behaviours. We'll discover a place with a very dry skin but a wet hidden heart that allows even aquatic birds or amphibians to live. Living in such conditions is not easy and it's only the toughest animals that will survive.</desc>
