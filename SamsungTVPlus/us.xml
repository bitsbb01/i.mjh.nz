When Dalton's brought in to clean up a popular establishment that has become particularly rowdy, his calm is put to the test by the nasty local kingpin (Ben Gazzara) in this throwback to the great westerns of the 40s and 50s.</desc>

    <desc>''Episode 12'' -In this final episode, after five weeks on the island, the men are struggling to find enough to eat as the island's already depleted resources fail to deliver the coconuts and limpets that have become their staple diet. With energy levels at rock bottom, the island's oldest castaway - 58-year-old car salesman Phil - is forgotten when an unsatisfying watery fish broth is served for lunch. The oversight sees the men galvanize themselves to recapture their team spirit of old. The men decide that the only way to slow their physical decline is to put the last of their remaining energy into hunting for meat to eat. After a daring capture, the men feast on their first taste of meat in weeks, and their energy and spirits are revived. Finally, Bear Grylls arrives to bring the men back to civilization. In an emotional farewell, the men's last act is for web designer Kyle to finally extinguish the fire that he started 41 days ago.</desc>

    <title>The Sun: Inferno In The Sky</title>
    <desc>At first glance, our sun seems quiet - but it isn't. It's an incredibly dynamic place, a world of extremes...
On July 23rd, 2012, a massive eruption on the sun hurls a colossal cloud of solar matter into space. It's the most severe sunstorm in 150 years.
Fortunately, the Earth is not in the direct path of this solar ejection. But it's only a matter of time before a violent solar storm hits us. When these clouds of charged matter reach our planet, they can wreak havoc in electrical systems. Previous sunstorms have resulted in large-scale power outages and the total loss of satellites.
An important indicator for solar activity is sunspots - darker areas that are a little cooler than the rest of the sun's surface. Scientists at the Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory in Carinthia, Austria, monitor sunspots every day. They send their observations to the World Data Centre of the Sunspot Index in Bruxelles, where other experts are trying to predict the sun's behaviour so they can forecast space weather.
'The Sun - Inferno in the Sky', presents the latest developments in solar science and offers fresh, unexpected and even controversial insights into the work of scientists all around the world.</desc>

    <title>The Library</title>
    <desc>As we seek to honor and celebrate the countless LGBTQ individuals, communities, sub-communities, and dynasties that have flourished in the face of adversity over decades, it dawned on us that there are so many unknown and untold stories about gay history, vocabulary, vernacular, and the human experiences that fuel the formation of cultures and identities based on authentic self-expression and love. As we discovered these stories, we wished for a gay "library" where anyone could visit and learn, in bite-size portions, about crucial events in gay history, gay heroes and icons past and present, fascinating sub-cultures, slang terms, scientific references, political movements... Essentially, a record of all the bits of queer education that are at risk of being lost or misinterpreted — information that we all crave as members of LGBTQ communities and as Allies. Do you know the story of the first Pride parade? Ever wondered what "Skoliosexual," "Polycule," or "Doppelbanger" means? The Library is open — and ready to clue you in.</desc>

    <desc>Tuna, which is often served rare to medium-rare, can be particularly tricky to get just right, especially when you want a nicely seared crust.

We develop the best recipes to highlight the best of both fish.</desc>

    <desc>Host Kevin O'Connor visits the architectural marvel next door, the Dollut Steamboat house, with its owner, Don Gagnon. Back at our house, master carpenter Norm Abram meets homeowner Rashida Ferdinand and general contractor Larry Schneider for a progress tour. In addition to painting and flooring, the cabinets are mostly up in the new kitchen. Installer Oliver Earl shows Norm both the architectural details and the finish details of the cabinetry. Right behind him is countertop contractor John Finney, who's making templates for the new quartz countertops using laser technology. At the Musicians' Village, general contractor Tom Silva is on hand for the morning meeting and then gives construction assistant Danielle Draper a lesson in making a window stool and apron. In Central City, Kevin meets Craig Cuccia to see how his non-profit group rebuilds the lives of at-risk youth through a unique hospitality and construction program.

    <title>New Orleans | One Small Corner Restored</title>
    <desc>Host Kevin O'Connor opens the show as the Krewe of Zulu prepares for Mardi Gras. In Holy Cross, landscape contractor Roger Cook arrives to find metal worker Joe Strain finishing the installation of the "hoop and scroll" iron fence in the front yard.

Back Uptown, the party continues as Kevin "rolls" with the Zulus down St. Charles Avenue on Mardi Gras day. The next day in Holy Cross, landscape architect Brian Sublette gives a final tour of the front garden and side yard, while inside, homeowner Rashida Ferdinand and her interior designer, Nancy Robbins, show Kevin the choices they made to blend the old house with the new addition, while using Rashida's artwork to personalize the spaces.

    <desc>Joining us on this week's I'm LIVE is singer-songwriter 10CM! 10CM is a solo act that initially started a band consisting of two members. The name referred to the height difference between them - 10 cm.

In March, 10CM held the first #TogetherAtHome concert in Korea after watching Coldplay singer Chris Martin perform a live concert online for people stuck indoors due to the spread of the coronavirus. Then in October, the artist held a real-time online solo performance for the first time as a non-idol musician. In this episode, 10CM performs songs from his latest album "Winter Breath" and "Before Our Night Is Over," as well as his hits "pet," "Phonecert" and "Stalker" to delight our ears and souls.

Then in April 2014, he released a self-written song "View" through the compilation album, "bright #2," and his debut album, "One Word," in November, officially starting a singing career of his own. Thanks to his dexterity in playing guitar, he has played with a number of top musicians, including Park Hyo-shin, Kim Dong-ryul, IU and more. Last month in November, Jukjae released his second mini-album, "2006," the year Jukjae describes as “the most beautiful and innocent time” in his life.

In this episode, Jukjae performs "Shining, My 2006," "The Door," "Do You Want To Walk With Me?" "Let's Go See the Stars," and "View."

    <title>The Cloud - Episode 301</title>
    <desc>A storm is brewing over Knighton. Monstrox has taken the form of a cloud, and is raising an army of lightning infused Stone Monsters. His first target is the new Lavalands Amusement Park. Harmony reigns in Knighton as the Knights pursue their civilian lives: Lance has a TV talk show  Axl is the singing chef on the show  Jestro is the weatherman  Clay is teaching at the Knights' Academy  Macy, Ava and Merlok 2.0 travel the land in the Fortrex making sure the kingdom's defenses are ready (part of a plan she and Clay have)  Aaron and his hover shield is travelling the land setting extreme records. Robin is at his workshop at the Knights' Academy doing an "independent study" - he's working on some top secret project for Merlok 2.0. It all seems excellent! We even see the Knights new vehicles - which have been optimized for civilian life (except for Clay's.) But storm clouds are brewing. Well, one storm cloud is brewing: the Cloud of Monstrox! Yes, the Book of Monsters has reconstituted himself and is now a cloud who needs a man on the ground to enact his new evil plan. He follows his old buddy Jestro as he goes across the realm on the weekends apologizing for being evil. ZAP! With one bolt of his evil magic lighting, the Cloud of Monstrox turns Jestro evil again (only this time a bit, well, too evil.) The evil duo are back together - and bring stone to life for the first time in the form of Gargoyles from the town of GHOULIA. Now they must gather the Forbidden Powers so that the Cloud of Monstrox can destroy the entire kingdom! A battle breaks out in the Lava Lands, where Lance and Alice Squires are reporting from the opening of the Cuthbert Richmond funded Lava Lands Amusement Park, rebuilt from the remains of Jestro's old HQ. Jestro and the Cloud are after something in the remains and as Merlok 2.0 sends out a call for the Knights to help Lance. Can Lance (with an assist from King Halbert in his Mech) hold-off Jestro, the Cloud and their new army of stone fighters?!</desc>

    <title>The Island Of Darkness</title>
    <desc>After battling off Garmadon's Stone Army, the Ninjas finally arrive at the Temple of Light where they harness their pure elemental powers, concentrating them onto Lloyd who becomes more powerful than he ever imagined. The Ninja camouflage the Bounty, creating a secret rebel base on the island. Misako says they must find the Temple of Light, because only when their elemental powers return, will they be strong enough to defeat the indestructible Stone Army. The Ninja search the dark, exotic island and come across Garmadon's compound, where they're building the Super-Weapon. The Ninja discover the Temple of Light is hidden at the highest peak of the island, and the Tinkerer aids their trek in creating a Drill Dozer so they can travel underground unnoticed. A final chase and battle takes place at the Temple of Light, as the Ninja solve the puzzle and harness their pure elemental powers, concentrating them onto Lloyd, who also becomes more powerful then he ever imagined. Their new abilities can destroy the indestructible Stone Warriors. Although Lord Garmadon finds this to be a setback, the Overlord reassures him darkness will prevail, as we end on seeing the Celestial Clock ticking down closer to zero.</desc>

    <desc>The Cloud of Monstrox and Jestro unlocks a mysterious Forbidden Power. What kind ofhavoc will they unleash? And can Merlok 2.0 and the NEXO KNIGHTS make the new COMBO NEXO Powers  work? The Knights finally make it to the Lava Lands - using their various new forms of transport, which are all strictly civilian vechicles - and they must regroup and learn to fight together again to face the new threat of Jestro, the Cloud of Monstrox, and their STONE MONSTERS (in this case, Stone Gargoyles.) But Jestro and his monsters beat back the knights and recover the STAFF OF MONSTROX - which was buried under the ceremonial chamber from Episode 210 (and is now the Lava Puker amusement park ride) - and they get away on Jestro's EVIL MOBILE, which he recovers from the HQ garage. Macy says this is exactly why she's been touring the kingdom preparing everyone for the next attack. The Knights have to get it together because now the entire kingdom is under threat...again. Robin decides he must upgrade the Knights' vehicles and make them more "fight optimized." Ava and Merlok 2.0 must figure out how to use new NEXO Powers because regular NEXO Powers do make Stone monsters back into stone, but the Cloud simply zaps them to life again. Meanwhile, in the IRON MOUNTAINS, Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox find the first of the Forbidden Powers: RELENTLESS RUST. They find the ROGUL STATUE holding the power and zap him to life. Now...they can rust those shiny knights to pieces! Ava and Merlok are attempting to use NEXO COMBO POWERS - with hilarious results - as they try to figure out how they might work. When Jestro attacks, he's able to halt the Fortrex by instantly rusting its tracks and wheels! Robin has his hands full trying to clean all the rust from the attack of Relentless Rust. As the Knights attempt to defend against Jestro, the Cloud is zapping statues to life. He hits a statue with a bolt of lightning as Clay is touching it. Something happens...Clay feels odd  stiff  as if rock is mixing with his body. Finally, Ava and Merlok 2.0 download to the Knights their new thing: a COMBO NEXO COMBO Power. It works! It can smash the animated statues to dust! They use it to defeat Jestro, but he and the Cloud get away with the Forbidden Power of Relentless Rust. Victory ... sort of. Clay talks to Merlok 2.0...something has happened to him. What can they do? Merlok 2.0 is very concerned.</desc>

    <title>The Last Hope</title>
    <desc>When the Ninjas' attempt to return Garmadon's 'Helmet of Darkness' to its perch at the Celestial Clock in order to prevent the final battle between Lloyd and his father from beginning fails, a Super Weapon is created that can destroy all of Ninjago. With the Overlord and Garmadon nearing completion of the Super-Weapon, Misako tells the group she thinks there could be one last chance at preventing Lloyd's final battle with his father. She believes if they can steal the helmet off Garmadon's head and return it to it's rightful perch on the Celestial Clock, it could stop the clock before it reaches zero, thus preventing the final battle from beginning. Dressed as Warriors, the Ninja escort their 'captive' Misako to Garmadon, and the heroes see glimpses of the Super-Weapon being built. In a thrilling escape, Misako cleverly steals Garmadon's helmet, and they race to the Celestial Clock. Lloyd has a brief encounter with his father, and hesitates striking him. When they return the helmet to its rightful perch, they're one second too late, allowing the clock to reach zero, and for it to focus a beam of concentrated light from the sky into the Super-Weapon. Nya is taken hostage, as the others fall off a cliff, barely surviving the fall. The Ninja have failed -- the final battle has begun.</desc>

    <title>Thunderstox - Episode 303</title>
    <desc>Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox encounters the sculptor. He helps unleash a horde of fierce garden gnomes on Knighton. What will the NEXO KNIGHTS do against this new enemy? Will their new COMBO NEXO Powers do the trick? As Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox head off on the Evil Mobile to 'store' the Forbidden Power in a secret location, they encounter...THE SCULPTOR. His real name is ROBERTO ARNOLDI. He's a sensitive and odd artist who has been laid off by the king (the King ordered a "smashing" statue of the Queen, and the Sculptor made a statue of the Queen literally smashing monsters. He takes everything very literally.) Jestro instructs him to make a "bad" statue that he can use to attack the knights. The Sculptor sets to work. Meanwhile, the NEXO KNIGHTS are discussing the COMBO NEXO Powers, the Forbidden Powers, and what all this means. Lance, meanwhile, decides that since his talk show career is on hold, he thinks he'll install cameras in the Fortrex and do a Big Brother-like expose show on the Knights (he decides NOT to tell the others.) Merlok 2.0 and the Cloud of Monstrox (each talking to their cohorts) explain the history of the Forbidden Powers: it's a history lesson about the WIZARDS' COUNCIL, the Forbidden Powers, and how they were stopped long ago. This visual montage leads Jestro to...MOUNT THUNDERSTROX. The Cloud of Monstrox shows him the circle of ten Standing Stones where he will insert the Forbidden Powers. "What'll happen after that?" asks Jestro, curious. "Oh, I don't want to spoil the surprise," says the Cloud. They insert the first Forbidden Power, Relentless Rust, and it locks into place on its stone. They go off to battle the Knights and collect the "bad" statue the sculptor is making. But he's made a literally bad statue...it's terrible ... garden gnomes. Like an amateur art student. And...it's not even finished. ("You can't rush bad genius!") The Knights attack with their newly modified vehicles and they succeed in destroying the Evil Mobile. They then try to use a COMBO NEXO Power, but can't...it had to be perfect to work (Ava and Merlok need to work on it.) As Jestro and the Cloud retreat, Merlok again talks to Clay about turning to stone! Merlok calls in Robin...he will need him to build something to help Clay as he becomes more and more impaired.</desc>

    <title>Return Of The Overlord</title>
    <desc>When Garmadon uses his new Super-Weapon to turn Jamakai Village evil, he unwittingly unsettles the balance, allowing the spirit of the Overlord to cross over and possesses his body. Lord Garmadon witnesses the Super-Weapon come to life, revealing it to be 'Garma-Tron', a giant moving cannon. His first test subject is Nya. Meanwhile, the heroes prepare for the final battle and sneak-attack Garmadon's compound...only to find it empty. The Super-Weapon is moving towards the coastline, where the cannon's range can reach Ninjago. On the way there, the Ninja must face off with Evil Nya, turned dark from the Super-Weapon. On the coastline, Lloyd battles his father atop Garma-Tron. The battle is fierce, but Lloyd fails at stopping his father from firing Garma-Tron, turning Jamanakai Village evil. Garmadon naively celebrates, not realizing he's undone the balance, allowing the spirit of the Overlord to cross over and possess his body. And as the Overlord continues to get more powerful, a hideous metamorphosis is taking place. Lloyd must fight the Overlord, and just when it looks like good will prevail, Lloyd is injured and thrown to the ground. In the end, the villains escape through a portal to Ninjago, and our heroes are abandoned on the island with no way home. And with the Green Ninja injured, it looks like all is lost. Evil has won.</desc>

    <title>Rotten Luck - Episode 304</title>
    <desc>Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox unleashes the Forbidden Power Ravaging Rot on Knighton! Turning everything into green gooey rot. But Robin has an awesome new invention that could help the NEXO KNIGHTS Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox find a second Forbidden Power near the falling down Swamp Castle: RAVAGING ROT. With this power, they can make everything in the kingdom rot - food, vegetation, anything that grows or is natural. And that's exactly what they do! It's awful and makes everything stink. The Sculptor start to sculpt a portable HeadQuarter for his master, Jestro. Jestro expects it to be done when they return from ravaging the land. Axl is very concerned - he's into organic food ... and now food starts to rot. Merlok 2.0 and Ava are continuing to work on perfecting the COMBO NEXO Powers. We see display screens of MANY of the NEXO Powers. But there's a huge power consumption issue with these new-fangled combos. "I'll have to find an algorithmic power curve consumption solution, magic man," says Ava. "I always just sort of choose them by, uh, feel." "What do you feel like?" "Uh, a ham sandwich, a banana, and dragon fire," responds Merlok. "That produced a combo with 2% efficiency," says Ava. "This is why we have to actually THINK about and study perfec Combos. We need automatic power integration." The Knights must stop Jestro from rotting all the food and living plant matter in Knighton and Axl leads the charge. But as they finally confront Jestro, who's trying to rot a field of beans near Fruitbridge, they're hit by his finally completed ROLLING HQ (the Sculptor is proud of the "artsy" elements.) ... it's not exactly perfect though ... he took the idea of Head Quarter a little too litteral and created a big head. Finally, in this conclusive battle where the knights get strapped on a rotting bridge, Clay emerges in a sleek, new BATTLE SUIT that Robin built for him because he was starting to have trouble moving around (the whole turning to stone thing.) It's smaller and more high-tech than the bigger Mechs of the past. Clay's able to drive Jestro off. Jestro, at the end of the episode, puts the Forbidden Power of Ravaging Rot into Mount Thunderstrox. Meanwhile, back at the Fortrex, Axl makes an organic food feast for all his fellow Knights.</desc>

    <desc>When Jestro the Jester finds the Book of Monsters, chaos breaks loose in the Kingdom of Knighton.  Can the newly graduated Knights from the Knights' Academy save the kingdom? It's final graduation fighting exams for the latest Knights from Knights' Academy.  All our new Knights demonstrate their prowess: CLAY, AARON, AXL and LANCE.  PRINCESS MACY get to join them, but her father doesn't want her to graduate.  As part of the entertainment, MERLOK does an amazing magic trick.  His act is followed by...JESTRO, the King's Jester.  He's terrible (and he should know to never follow a better act.) Everyone laughed because he's a real joke....a total failure. While Jestro roams the halls fo the King's Castle, forlorn, he hears the BOOK OF MONSTERS calling to him from Merlok's library. The book talks Jestro into gathering as many books of spells as he can carry, but they're interrupted by...Clay! As Jestro quickly pages through the Book of Monsters to attack Clay, Merlok arrives. There's a battle in the library between Jestro and Merlok. Finally, the wizard summons up his most powerful spell in self-defence. BOOM! There's a big, magical explosion and when Clay forces his way back into the library, Merlok, Jestro and the magic books are...GONE!</desc>

Then Macy remembers her dad has a royal RV...maybe they can "mod" that for their own, "knightly" use? Now the NEXO-Knights get rolling...in THE FORTREX, their own ROLLING CASTLE!  This great new HQ, which houses Merlok 2.0 as an operating system, will be how the knights move around Knighton and protect it from Jestro and his monsters.  Speaking of the evil jester, in this episode Jestro uses some newly-made monsters to attack a town far from the capitol where he thinks he's safe from the Knights' reach.  We see two parallel stories here: the Knights training, learning more about digital magic and getting organized as a team and at the same time we see Jestro making monsters, trying to learn how his powers work and talking to the Book.  In the end, the Knights roll up in their castle and defeat Jestro and his marauding monsters.  Lance thinks he should be the leader because he's a snot.

    <title>The Golden Castle - Episode 106</title>
    <desc>When Lance is cast as the star in the new remake of the classic movie "Ned Knightly and the Golden Castle" he doesn't anticipate Jestro and his monsters invading the set and ruining his starring role. It's movie time!  Lance does something very Lance: he agrees to star in a movie about remake of a classic film in Knighton: "The Golden Castle."  While pillaging a village, Jestro and the Book of Monsters see a movie poster for "The Golden Castle" and the book says the legendary Golden Castle is filled with riches!  Jestro explains that it's just a dumb movie and that it's not real.  It's all based on a "script."  The Book, who's been shelved for many years, wants to eat the movie script to learn more about the modern world.  On the set of the movie, Lance has invited the other Knights to act as extras.  When they see how Lance is being portrayed, they're incensed.  When Jestro attacks the movie set to get the script for his book to eat, the film director keeps rolling.  This battle footage is fantastic!  The Knights defeat Jestro even though the movie set is trashed.  The director will make it work.  At the premier of the movie, Lance is embarrassed to see that he's been reduced to comic relief for the realm's bravest Knight...Macy!  The director has now made her a star.</desc>

    <title>Europe's Largest Desert</title>
    <desc>Near the cold Pyrenees of Iberia, surrounded by ancient and dark green forests, there is an odd land where the rain is so scarce and the wind is always blowing. The soil is poor, there are no trees and the landscape has become very much like the moon. Is this what the future of desertification will look like?  

This strange landscape is home to incredible creatures with surprising behaviours. We'll discover a place with a very dry skin but a wet hidden heart that allows even aquatic birds or amphibians to live. Living in such conditions is not easy and it's only the toughest animals that will survive.</desc>
