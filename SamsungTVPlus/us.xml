When Dalton's brought in to clean up a popular establishment that has become particularly rowdy, his calm is put to the test by the nasty local kingpin (Ben Gazzara) in this throwback to the great westerns of the 40s and 50s.</desc>

    <title>The Sun: Inferno In The Sky</title>
    <desc>At first glance, our sun seems quiet - but it isn't. It's an incredibly dynamic place, a world of extremes...
On July 23rd, 2012, a massive eruption on the sun hurls a colossal cloud of solar matter into space. It's the most severe sunstorm in 150 years.
Fortunately, the Earth is not in the direct path of this solar ejection. But it's only a matter of time before a violent solar storm hits us. When these clouds of charged matter reach our planet, they can wreak havoc in electrical systems. Previous sunstorms have resulted in large-scale power outages and the total loss of satellites.
An important indicator for solar activity is sunspots - darker areas that are a little cooler than the rest of the sun's surface. Scientists at the Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory in Carinthia, Austria, monitor sunspots every day. They send their observations to the World Data Centre of the Sunspot Index in Bruxelles, where other experts are trying to predict the sun's behaviour so they can forecast space weather.
'The Sun - Inferno in the Sky', presents the latest developments in solar science and offers fresh, unexpected and even controversial insights into the work of scientists all around the world.</desc>

    <title>New Orleans | Return to New Orleans, Post Katrina</title>
    <desc>For the second project of the season, This Old House travels to New Orleans, Louisiana, to help a fourth-generation resident of the Lower 9th Ward return home, while following stories of rebuilding and recovery throughout the city. Host Kevin O'Connor visits Musicians' Village with founder Harry Connick, Jr. to see how he, along with childhood friend Branford Marsalis, are providing new housing for the city's musicians through Habitat for Humanity. In historic Holy Cross, along the banks of the Mississippi River, homeowner Rashida Ferdinand shows Kevin why she loves her c. 1892 flood-damaged shotgun single and artist's studio, and how she plans to restore and expand them after a two-year vacancy. Master carpenter Norm Abram meets up with her builder to assess the challenges of building in post-Katrina New Orleans, while homeowner Marna David shows Kevin how she managed to renovate her own shotgun single in Holy Cross, twice_Ñ_Õ†Õåonce before the storm, and once after.</desc>

    <title>New Orleans | Camelbacks, Bargeboard, and Toxic Mold</title>
    <desc>Back in New Orleans, Kevin meets homeowner Rashida Ferdinand and her architect Rick Fifield for a look at the plans and model of the proposed work to her shotgun single. The plan calls for a "camelback" addition that will house a master suite, and also a new family room with back and side porches to take advantage of the cool river breezes. As demolition begins inside, builder Carl Hithe shows master carpenter Norm Abram how the house was originally constructed from dismantled bargeboards taken from vessels that once traveled down the Mississippi. At Musicians' Village, Kevin meets Executive Director Jim Pate to see how Habitat for Humanity's houses are constructed post-Katrina, starting with an extensive foundation system that includes 35-foot deep pilings tied into a robust footing system. As work progresses at Rashida's house, the discovery of toxic mold is a setback, until mold remediation expert Dr. Eric Griggs arrives to begin a whole-house remediation and prevention program for the old part of the house.</desc>

At the project in Holy Cross, homeowner Rashida Ferdinand has some surprising news: Her old contractor couldn't complete the job, so she's hiring someone new, while filling in herself to bridge the gap between builders. On her brief watch, she's managed to obtain her rough inspections, so spray foam insulation gets underway in the new addition. For progress on the French doors, Norm visits carpenter Matt Thompson to see his renovated house and shop in Bywater, and also how he's milling our historically accurate doors out of Spanish cedar.

    <title>I'M LIVE: S1 E184</title>
    <desc>Joining us on this week's I'm LIVE is singer-songwriter 10CM! 10CM is a solo act that initially started a band consisting of two members. The name referred to the height difference between them - 10 cm. In 2017, however, one had to leave the group due to personal reasons and the main vocalist Kwon Jung-yeol continued on as a one-person band on his own under the name 10CM. In March, 10CM held the first #TogetherAtHome concert in Korea after watching Coldplay singer Chris Martin perform a live concert online for people stuck indoors due to the spread of the coronavirus. Then in October, the artist held a real-time online solo performance for the first time as a non-idol musician. In this episode, 10CM performs songs from his latest album "Winter Breath" and "Before Our Night Is Over," as well as his hits "pet," "Phonecert" and "Stalker" to delight our ears and souls. Tune in to I'm LIVE this week and fill your heart with Christmas vibes with 10CM!</desc>

    <title>I'M LIVE: S1 E181</title>
    <desc>Joining us on this week's I'm LIVE is guitarist and singer-songwriter Jukjae! This artist initially made his reputation in the music scene as a session guitarist, composer, and arranger. Then in April 2014, he released a self-written song "View" through the compilation album, "bright #2," and his debut album, "One Word," in November, officially starting a singing career of his own. Thanks to his dexterity in playing guitar, he has played with a number of top musicians, including Park Hyo-shin, Kim Dong-ryul, IU and more. Last month in November, Jukjae released his second mini-album, "2006," the year Jukjae describes as “the most beautiful and innocent time” in his life. With the lead single, "Shining, My 2006," he hopes people will look back at the time they were at their brightest and happiest, to escape reality for a brief moment. In this episode, Jukjae performs "Shining, My 2006," "The Door," "Do You Want To Walk With Me?" "Let's Go See the Stars," and "View." Tune in to "I'm LIVE" and take a glimpse into his artistry!</desc>

    <title>Open Mike Knight - Episode 208</title>
    <desc>The Book of Betrayal leads Jestro and his Monsters to Funnyton - the funnies town in the kingdom.  When they Knights arrive to capture him, they discover (to their shock) that Jestro and the Book of Monsters are now the town's top comedians! Jestro and his monsters are in attack formation moving to pillage the town of Funnyton.  But when they arrive, ready to tear into the place, they see that nobody's in town.  Then, they hear...laughter?!  The entire town is there listening to a stand-up comic JOKES  KNIGHTLY.  He's hilarious.  He commands such power, such attention, and such loyalty.  Jestro and the BOM decide they must become funny.  They order all kinds of book on comedy from Spamazon: books on parody, irony, insult humor, slapstick, satire, knock-knock jokes, elephant jokes, "my monster is so fat" jokes, etc.  They work-up a ventriloquist act with the BOM sitting on Jestro's lap.  They start doing their act and, surprisingly, they're funny.  They're very funny.   The Fortrex arrives and the knights rush out, ready for battle.  They fight through a string of monsters just outside the town, but discover they're only working as "bouncers" to keep too many people out of the comedy club.  ("Sorry, you guys aren't on the list.") The knights hear loud laughs and head there.  In the club, they discover the town isn't being held hostage, they're in the show voluntarily having a great time.  And...Jestro and the BOM are funny.  Meanwhile, during the show, Jokes Knightly decides he'll steal the BOM and Jestro's act.  During the intermission at the comedy show, Clay comes backstage to talk to Jestro.  Maybe, Clay says, this shows that Jestro doesn't have to be bad...he is funny, like Clay always said he was. Meanwhile, Jokes Knightly steals the BOM and Jestro can't find it.  He panics.  Clay encourages him...go on stage alone, be funny...he can do it!  Jestro goes out and is funny on his own  he hits all his punchlines, he gets big laughs  he starts to see that Clay is right.  The BOM sees that Jokes Knightly has a "joke book" that turns out to be the BOOK OF BETRAYAL.  That's how Mike Knight has become so funny - by stealing everyone's material!  BOM calls in Magmar, who saves him from Mike Knight AND takes the Book of Betrayal.  As Jestro comes off-stage to great applause, the BOM tells him they have the Book of Betrayal.  The BOM calls in Magmar and his monsters and they start a fight as Clay comes to Jestro's defense and calls on the other Knights for backup.  A big battle ensues that destroys the comedy club in Funnyton.  The Knights win and drive-off Magmar, the monsters and the BOM.  As they retreat, the BOM looks around: "Where's my Jestro?!"  Jestro sneaked away during the fight and is in a nearby forest with...the Book of Betrayal.</desc>

With the help of her Friends, she tries hard to overcome her fear, but her nightmarish visions of snowboard monsters and jeering snowmen have her shaking in her bed.  She backs out of the race, disappointing her Friends and herself.  Finally, when an avalanche traps Fiona, Mia is forced to overcome her fears and race to the rescue.</desc>

    <title>The Stone Army</title>
    <desc>The ninja face off with an exhibit of a Stone Samurai Warrior that the toxic venom from the Great Devourer has brought to life while Garmadon manages to find a fabled Dark Island that is said to hold dark powers. Lord Garmadon struggles controlling the Serpentine now that he is without the Mega-Weapon. His latest endeavor is to lead the snakes in search of a fabled Dark Island that ancient texts say holds dark powers. Unable to find the island, the furious Serpentine abandon Lord Garmadon out at sea. Meanwhile, Lloyd and the Ninja are called to the museum to find the toxic venom from the Great Devourer has seeped into the ground beneath the city, and it's brought an exhibit of a Stone Samurai Warrior to life! Our heroes come across Misako, Lloyd's long lost mother. She's an archeologist in search of stopping the prophesized battle between Lloyd and his father. She had unearthed the Stone Warrior, and shares how it was once part of an indestructible army created by a dark spirit named The Overlord.  When the balance is altered and evil is let into Ninjago, it will allow the Overlord to return and bring darkness and destruction to the land. Unable to destroy the Terminator-like Stone Warrior, the Ninja cleverly trap it. In the end, Lord Garmadon awakens on a small island at sea and hears the voice of the banished Overlord, promising him his wildest dreams. Garmadon uses his four hands to activate a mechanism, raising a lost land from out of the sea, creating a Yin/Yang symbol with Ninjago. The ultimate battle between good and evil begins to unfold.</desc>

    <title>The Fortrex And The Furious - Episode 209</title>
    <desc>In a massive chase around Knighton, the NEXO-Knights attempt to keep the Book of Betrayal out of the Book of Monster's grip.  But the evil book is persistent.  Will he get the final piece of his evil puzzle? We finally REVEAL that Jestro has given the Book of Betrayal to...Clay.  He tells Clay what it is and how Mike Knight used it.  And it seems that the Book of Monsters believed it to be the final ingredient in some 'Master Plan."  Suddenly, they realize Monsters - led by Magmar and the super-mad Book of Monster - are after them!  Clay retreats with Jestro and the Book of Betrayal to rendezvous with the other Knights at the Fortrex.  The Fortrex isn't fast enough  they'll need their own vehicles. They decide that they need to split up and go in multiple directions to make the monsters expend their resources on a chase.  It's a huge chase, being covered like a crazy news event by the Knighton News Network.  We see a montage of the monsters stopping and capturing all the Knights vehicles: Aaron, Macy, Lance...finally Axl.  However, as they do, they realize that the Knights have used Squirebots in Jestro Fan Jester hats (from the vendor at the comedy club in 108) as decoys.  They think Axl has the Book of Betrayal in his BRICK containment unit, but it turns out to be the Ned Knightly Comic from episode 203.  The Monsters finally corner Clay, who has the real Jestro and Book of Betrayal in his sword vehicle.  Before Clay can protest, Jestro pushes the launch button and fires off Clay in the vehicle's rocket sword.  The monsters race off with Jestro, leaving the shocked Clay fearing for his friend. Now, Magmar tells the Book of Monsters, they only need to get BOB.  Clay makes his way back to the Fortrex and tells what has happened. They decide they must get to the Redoubt of Ruination in the Lava Lands and try to save Jestro.  Meanwhile, we see, INTERCUT, a scene where Merlok 2.0 and the Book of Monsters explain the Books of Evil, how they were created and what the BOM will use them for.  Merlok, back in the day, split the evil MONSTRUX into 10 magic books to keep him from ever being a threat.  Only, he didn't destroy the books...and now the BOM has them and Monstrux can come back into the world!  Meanwhile, the BOM has set up the huge, ceremonial arena at their HQ so they can have the ceremony to bring Monstrux back into the world.  Jestro realizes he's been a pawn of the Book of Monsters.  Jestro says he'll never get the Book of Betrayal...the Knights have it.  In the last scene, we see Clay taking the Book of Betrayal from the Fortrex, climbing into his vehicle and driving towards...the Redoubt of Ruination!  Has the Book of Betrayal worked its evil magic on him?!</desc>

    <title>The Day Ninjago Stood Still</title>
    <desc>The ninja try to flee from the rest of the Stone Army that has been brought to life by the Devourer's toxic venom - and things get a lot worse when Garmadon arrives with a 'Helmet of Darkness' and seizes control of the Stone Army. Scales finally takes leadership over the Serpentine and plans to burrow beneath Ninjago City to level it to the ground. But as they burrow, they run into a lost chamber holding the rest of the Stone Army. The Devourer's toxic venom in the ground brings the Stone Army to life, sealing the Serpentine in their tomb, and returning the snakes back to where they were first found. On the Dark Island, the Overlord directs Lord Garmadon to a giant celestial clock. Garmadon removes a 'Helmet of Darkness', which will grant the wearer control over the Stone Army, and also activate the clock to tick down to when the final battle will begin. Back in Ninjago City, the indestructible Stone Army surfaces and attacks, and the Ninja know the only thing they can do is to save as many people as they can. They manage to barely escape with other townspeople, only for the Destiny's Bounty's engines to get damaged. In the end, Lord Garmadon arrives with the helmet, and seizes control of the Stone Army.</desc>

    <title>Kingdom Of Heroes - Episode 210</title>
    <desc>The Book of Monsters, having the final pieces of his evil plan in place, tries to take human form.  Can the NEXO-Knights and Merlok 2.0 stop the greatest threat they've ever faced?  Or will the kingdom be plunged into darkness...forever. The Redoubt of Ruination readies the final ceremony to call forth MONSTRUX, the arch-necromancer of the past.  Clay, holding the Book of Betrayal walks to the gates of the spooky place.  Inside, Clay hears strange...singing and music.  It's like a twisted Broadway show of some kind.  Meanwhile, the Knights all realize Clay is gone and so is the Book of Betrayal.  Macy says Clay must be up to something.  They have to trust him and, more importantly, they have to find him.  At the Redoubt of Ruination the ceremony has already begun!  The Book of Monsters wants the final ceremony that calls forth Monstrux to be like a really great show!  The BOM then barfs up all the BOOKS OF EVIL into their places around Jestro.  He's just missing the BOOK OF BETRAYAL, which Clay has.  Clay says he'll trade the book for Jestro.  The BOM immediately agrees to the deal and sets Jestro free.  Then, Monsters grab-up Clay, restrain him, and put him in Jestro's place on the sacrifice stone.  From outside, they're interrupted by the sounds of battle  the Knights have arrived on the Fortrex and are attacking the Redoubt of Ruination.  In the confusion, Jestro slips away.  The BOM lets loose with a powerful protection spell to keep the Knights out as he starts with the ceremony...he's going to bring Monstrux out and remanifest him in Clay's body!  Jestro is able to escape the Redoubt and make his way to the Knights, who can't seem to battle their way in.  It's a race against time as the Knights try to get in and save Clay.  As the Knights get in, they see that the crazy BOM is absorbing all the Books of Evil, one-by-one.  He grows BIGGER and BIGGER!  Macy calls for NEXO-Power...but it's not enough!  The gigantic Book of Monsters sucks down the final book, the Book of Betrayal!  He looms over Clay, about to consume him, too, and make him into Monstrux!  Suddenly, Robin appears carrying TECHKALIBER...he tosses it to Clay.  Just as the huge Book of Monsters falls on Clay, he holds up Techkaliber and Merlok 2.0 is there...his full power in the sword.  Clay sticks the sword into the Book of Monster's huge mouth.  BOOM!  There's a BIG, MAGICAL EXPLOSION!  As we cut back inside, we see the Book of Monsters is gone.  The Knights release Clay and he thanks them and Jestro for saving him.  Jestro thanks them all for saving him and seeing the good in him.  WE DISSOLVE TO: The JoustDome.  In a final ceremony the King and Queen reward the knights and congratulate them for keeping the kingdom safe.  There are speeches, happiness and friendship.  And Jestro even does a bit that's funny.  At the very end we see a hint of something...Monstrux and the Book of Monsters are still out there.</desc>

The Stone Army and Lord Garmadon have disappeared, and our heroes can see the mysterious Dark Island off their coastline. Fearing Garmadon is up to no good, Sensei Wu has the whole team suit up to begin a journey to the Dark Island. Since the Bounty's engines are damaged, they plan to go by sea.

Meanwhile, Lord Garmadon has the Army mining for more 'Dark Matter', using it to build a Super-Weapon that will recreate Ninjago in a twisted evil way. When a storm hits at sea, our heroes are attacked by Starteeth (barnacle-like starfish that can eat through a ship) and are forced to find refuge on a lighthouse at sea. Inside, Zane discovers his inventor father, the Tinkerer, is alive!  Together, they repair the Bounty so it can fly again, escaping a giant Leviathan, and soaring to the Dark Island ahead.</desc>

    <title>The Cloud - Episode 301</title>
    <desc>A storm is brewing over Knighton. Monstrox has taken the form of a cloud, and is raising an army of lightning infused Stone Monsters. His first target is the new Lavalands Amusement Park. Harmony reigns in Knighton as the Knights pursue their civilian lives: Lance has a TV talk show  Axl is the singing chef on the show  Jestro is the weatherman  Clay is teaching at the Knights' Academy  Macy, Ava and Merlok 2.0 travel the land in the Fortrex making sure the kingdom's defenses are ready (part of a plan she and Clay have)  Aaron and his hover shield is travelling the land setting extreme records. Robin is at his workshop at the Knights' Academy doing an "independent study" - he's working on some top secret project for Merlok 2.0. It all seems excellent! We even see the Knights new vehicles - which have been optimized for civilian life (except for Clay's.) But storm clouds are brewing. Well, one storm cloud is brewing: the Cloud of Monstrox! Yes, the Book of Monsters has reconstituted himself and is now a cloud who needs a man on the ground to enact his new evil plan. He follows his old buddy Jestro as he goes across the realm on the weekends apologizing for being evil. ZAP! With one bolt of his evil magic lighting, the Cloud of Monstrox turns Jestro evil again (only this time a bit, well, too evil.) The evil duo are back together - and bring stone to life for the first time in the form of Gargoyles from the town of GHOULIA. Now they must gather the Forbidden Powers so that the Cloud of Monstrox can destroy the entire kingdom! A battle breaks out in the Lava Lands, where Lance and Alice Squires are reporting from the opening of the Cuthbert Richmond funded Lava Lands Amusement Park, rebuilt from the remains of Jestro's old HQ. Jestro and the Cloud are after something in the remains and as Merlok 2.0 sends out a call for the Knights to help Lance. Can Lance (with an assist from King Halbert in his Mech) hold-off Jestro, the Cloud and their new army of stone fighters?!</desc>

The Ninja camouflage the Bounty, creating a secret rebel base on the island. Misako says they must find the Temple of Light, because only when their elemental powers return, will they be strong enough to defeat the indestructible Stone Army. The Ninja search the dark, exotic island and come across Garmadon's compound, where they're building the Super-Weapon. The Ninja discover the Temple of Light is hidden at the highest peak of the island, and the Tinkerer aids their trek in creating a Drill Dozer so they can travel underground unnoticed.

The Knights finally make it to the Lava Lands - using their various new forms of transport, which are all strictly civilian vechicles - and they must regroup and learn to fight together again to face the new threat of Jestro, the Cloud of Monstrox, and their STONE MONSTERS (in this case, Stone Gargoyles.) But Jestro and his monsters beat back the knights and recover the STAFF OF MONSTROX - which was buried under the ceremonial chamber from Episode 210 (and is now the Lava Puker amusement park ride) - and they get away on Jestro's EVIL MOBILE, which he recovers from the HQ garage. Macy says this is exactly why she's been touring the kingdom preparing everyone for the next attack. The Knights have to get it together because now the entire kingdom is under threat...again. Robin decides he must upgrade the Knights' vehicles and make them more "fight optimized." Ava and Merlok 2.0 must figure out how to use new NEXO Powers because regular NEXO Powers do make Stone monsters back into stone, but the Cloud simply zaps them to life again. Meanwhile, in the IRON MOUNTAINS, Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox find the first of the Forbidden Powers: RELENTLESS RUST. They find the ROGUL STATUE holding the power and zap him to life. Now...they can rust those shiny knights to pieces! Ava and Merlok are attempting to use NEXO COMBO POWERS - with hilarious results - as they try to figure out how they might work. When Jestro attacks, he's able to halt the Fortrex by instantly rusting its tracks and wheels! Robin has his hands full trying to clean all the rust from the attack of Relentless Rust. As the Knights attempt to defend against Jestro, the Cloud is zapping statues to life. He hits a statue with a bolt of lightning as Clay is touching it. Something happens...Clay feels odd  stiff  as if rock is mixing with his body. Finally, Ava and Merlok 2.0 download to the Knights their new thing: a COMBO NEXO COMBO Power. It works! It can smash the animated statues to dust! They use it to defeat Jestro, but he and the Cloud get away with the Forbidden Power of Relentless Rust. Victory ... sort of.

With the Overlord and Garmadon nearing completion of the Super-Weapon, Misako tells the group she thinks there could be one last chance at preventing Lloyd's final battle with his father. She believes if they can steal the helmet off Garmadon's head and return it to it's rightful perch on the Celestial Clock, it could stop the clock before it reaches zero, thus preventing the final battle from beginning. Dressed as Warriors, the Ninja escort their 'captive' Misako to Garmadon, and the heroes see glimpses of the Super-Weapon being built. In a thrilling escape, Misako cleverly steals Garmadon's helmet, and they race to the Celestial Clock. Lloyd has a brief encounter with his father, and hesitates striking him. When they return the helmet to its rightful perch, they're one second too late, allowing the clock to reach zero, and for it to focus a beam of concentrated light from the sky into the Super-Weapon. Nya is taken hostage, as the others fall off a cliff, barely surviving the fall. The Ninja have failed -- the final battle has begun.</desc>

    <title>Thunderstox - Episode 303</title>
    <desc>Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox encounters the sculptor. He helps unleash a horde of fierce garden gnomes on Knighton. What will the NEXO KNIGHTS do against this new enemy? Will their new COMBO NEXO Powers do the trick? As Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox head off on the Evil Mobile to 'store' the Forbidden Power in a secret location, they encounter...THE SCULPTOR. His real name is ROBERTO ARNOLDI. He's a sensitive and odd artist who has been laid off by the king (the King ordered a "smashing" statue of the Queen, and the Sculptor made a statue of the Queen literally smashing monsters. He takes everything very literally.) Jestro instructs him to make a "bad" statue that he can use to attack the knights. The Sculptor sets to work. Meanwhile, the NEXO KNIGHTS are discussing the COMBO NEXO Powers, the Forbidden Powers, and what all this means. Lance, meanwhile, decides that since his talk show career is on hold, he thinks he'll install cameras in the Fortrex and do a Big Brother-like expose show on the Knights (he decides NOT to tell the others.) Merlok 2.0 and the Cloud of Monstrox (each talking to their cohorts) explain the history of the Forbidden Powers: it's a history lesson about the WIZARDS' COUNCIL, the Forbidden Powers, and how they were stopped long ago. This visual montage leads Jestro to...MOUNT THUNDERSTROX. The Cloud of Monstrox shows him the circle of ten Standing Stones where he will insert the Forbidden Powers. "What'll happen after that?" asks Jestro, curious. "Oh, I don't want to spoil the surprise," says the Cloud. They insert the first Forbidden Power, Relentless Rust, and it locks into place on its stone. They go off to battle the Knights and collect the "bad" statue the sculptor is making. But he's made a literally bad statue...it's terrible ... garden gnomes. Like an amateur art student. And...it's not even finished. ("You can't rush bad genius!") The Knights attack with their newly modified vehicles and they succeed in destroying the Evil Mobile. They then try to use a COMBO NEXO Power, but can't...it had to be perfect to work (Ava and Merlok need to work on it.) As Jestro and the Cloud retreat, Merlok again talks to Clay about turning to stone! Merlok calls in Robin...he will need him to build something to help Clay as he becomes more and more impaired.</desc>

Lord Garmadon witnesses the Super-Weapon come to life, revealing it to be 'Garma-Tron', a giant moving cannon. His first test subject is Nya. Meanwhile, the heroes prepare for the final battle and sneak-attack Garmadon's compound...only to find it empty. The Super-Weapon is moving towards the coastline, where the cannon's range can reach Ninjago. On the way there, the Ninja must face off with Evil Nya, turned dark from the Super-Weapon. On the coastline, Lloyd battles his father atop Garma-Tron. The battle is fierce, but Lloyd fails at stopping his father from firing Garma-Tron, turning Jamanakai Village evil. Garmadon naively celebrates, not realizing he's undone the balance, allowing the spirit of the Overlord to cross over and possess his body. And as the Overlord continues to get more powerful, a hideous metamorphosis is taking place. Lloyd must fight the Overlord, and just when it looks like good will prevail, Lloyd is injured and thrown to the ground. In the end, the villains escape through a portal to Ninjago, and our heroes are abandoned on the island with no way home. And with the Green Ninja injured, it looks like all is lost.

    <title>Rotten Luck - Episode 304</title>
    <desc>Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox unleashes the Forbidden Power Ravaging Rot on Knighton! Turning everything into green gooey rot. But Robin has an awesome new invention that could help the NEXO KNIGHTS Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox find a second Forbidden Power near the falling down Swamp Castle: RAVAGING ROT. With this power, they can make everything in the kingdom rot - food, vegetation, anything that grows or is natural. And that's exactly what they do! It's awful and makes everything stink. The Sculptor start to sculpt a portable HeadQuarter for his master, Jestro. Jestro expects it to be done when they return from ravaging the land. Axl is very concerned - he's into organic food ... and now food starts to rot. Merlok 2.0 and Ava are continuing to work on perfecting the COMBO NEXO Powers. We see display screens of MANY of the NEXO Powers. But there's a huge power consumption issue with these new-fangled combos. "I'll have to find an algorithmic power curve consumption solution, magic man," says Ava. "I always just sort of choose them by, uh, feel." "What do you feel like?" "Uh, a ham sandwich, a banana, and dragon fire," responds Merlok. "That produced a combo with 2% efficiency," says Ava. "This is why we have to actually THINK about and study perfec Combos. We need automatic power integration." The Knights must stop Jestro from rotting all the food and living plant matter in Knighton and Axl leads the charge. But as they finally confront Jestro, who's trying to rot a field of beans near Fruitbridge, they're hit by his finally completed ROLLING HQ (the Sculptor is proud of the "artsy" elements.) ... it's not exactly perfect though ... he took the idea of Head Quarter a little too litteral and created a big head. Finally, in this conclusive battle where the knights get strapped on a rotting bridge, Clay emerges in a sleek, new BATTLE SUIT that Robin built for him because he was starting to have trouble moving around (the whole turning to stone thing.) It's smaller and more high-tech than the bigger Mechs of the past. Clay's able to drive Jestro off. Jestro, at the end of the episode, puts the Forbidden Power of Ravaging Rot into Mount Thunderstrox. Meanwhile, back at the Fortrex, Axl makes an organic food feast for all his fellow Knights.</desc>

    <title>The Book Of Monsters, Part 1 - Episode 101</title>
    <desc>When Jestro the Jester finds the Book of Monsters, chaos breaks loose in the Kingdom of Knighton.  Can the newly graduated Knights from the Knights' Academy save the kingdom? It's final graduation fighting exams for the latest Knights from Knights' Academy.  All our new Knights demonstrate their prowess: CLAY, AARON, AXL and LANCE.  PRINCESS MACY get to join them, but her father doesn't want her to graduate.  As part of the entertainment, MERLOK does an amazing magic trick.  His act is followed by...JESTRO, the King's Jester.  He's terrible (and he should know to never follow a better act.) Everyone laughed because he's a real joke....a total failure. While Jestro roams the halls fo the King's Castle, forlorn, he hears the BOOK OF MONSTERS calling to him from Merlok's library. The book talks Jestro into gathering as many books of spells as he can carry, but they're interrupted by...Clay! As Jestro quickly pages through the Book of Monsters to attack Clay, Merlok arrives. There's a battle in the library between Jestro and Merlok. Finally, the wizard summons up his most powerful spell in self-defence. BOOM! There's a big, magical explosion and when Clay forces his way back into the library, Merlok, Jestro and the magic books are...GONE!</desc>

    <title>The Book Of Monsters, Part 2 - Episode 102</title>
    <desc>Realizing they must defend the Kingdom from Jestro's monsters, the Knights try to organize but are despondent when they discover their best advisor - Merlok the Magician - has sacrificed himself to save them.   When Jestro awakens, he's been blasted miles and miles away from the King's Castle by Merlok's explosive spell.  And, it seems, all the books he was trying to steal have been scattered, too.  The Book of Monsters broke Jestro' fall and now he can use the book to attack the people who laughed at him.  Meanwhile, the King and his newly-trained Knights pick through the rubble of Merlok's library.  They'll have to figure something out, because Jestro and his newly made magic monsters attack King's Castle!  Clay organizes the Knights to defend the kingdom, but they've never worked together before.  It takes all their training, plus the help of an old friend...MERLOK!  Only now he's MERLOK 2.0.  Ava has been piecing together what happened and discovering that the "ghost in the machine" she's been chasing is really Merlok in digital form.  Now, he can use his magic digitally and he downloads just the right weapons to the struggling Knights!  They finally foil Jestro's attack with Merlok's help and officially become NEXO KNIGHTS!</desc>

    <title>The Power Of Merlok - Episode 103</title>
    <desc>When Jestro attacks a village on the far side of the Kingdom, the NEXO-Knights wonder how they'll get there.  Then Macy remembers her dad has a royal RV...maybe they can "mod" that for their own, "knightly" use? Now the NEXO-Knights get rolling...in THE FORTREX, their own ROLLING CASTLE!  This great new HQ, which houses Merlok 2.0 as an operating system, will be how the knights move around Knighton and protect it from Jestro and his monsters.  Speaking of the evil jester, in this episode Jestro uses some newly-made monsters to attack a town far from the capitol where he thinks he's safe from the Knights' reach.  We see two parallel stories here: the Knights training, learning more about digital magic and getting organized as a team and at the same time we see Jestro making monsters, trying to learn how his powers work and talking to the Book.  In the end, the Knights roll up in their castle and defeat Jestro and his marauding monsters.  Lance thinks he should be the leader because he's a snot. "Of course I'm the leader...I'm a Richmond."</desc>

    <title>Whale Adventures With Nigel Marven</title>
    <desc>"An Incredible Journey Begins" - The newborn gray whale calves spend their first months of life in the safety of Baja's San Ignacio Lagoon, suckling and learning swimming skills before starting the first leg of their incredible journey. Nigel is spellbound by the 'friendly whales', mothers and calves that literally beg for his attention, rolling like puppy-dogs as he strokes them from his boat.

While at the lagoon, Nigel talks to the scientists studying the whales, and finds unexpected birds of prey nesting at the water's edge. As the whales start their journey north towards the border with the US, he takes a parallel road trip through the cacti-studded desert, meeting rattlesnakes, lizards and antelope en route.</desc>

    <title>Europe's Largest Desert</title>
    <desc>Near the cold Pyrenees of Iberia, surrounded by ancient and dark green forests, there is an odd land where the rain is so scarce and the wind is always blowing. The soil is poor, there are no trees and the landscape has become very much like the moon. Is this what the future of desertification will look like?  

This strange landscape is home to incredible creatures with surprising behaviours. We'll discover a place with a very dry skin but a wet hidden heart that allows even aquatic birds or amphibians to live. Living in such conditions is not easy and it's only the toughest animals that will survive.</desc>
