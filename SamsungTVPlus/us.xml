    <title>The Sun: Inferno In The Sky</title>
    <desc>At first glance, our sun seems quiet - but it isn't. It's an incredibly dynamic place, a world of extremes...
On July 23rd, 2012, a massive eruption on the sun hurls a colossal cloud of solar matter into space. It's the most severe sunstorm in 150 years.
Fortunately, the Earth is not in the direct path of this solar ejection. But it's only a matter of time before a violent solar storm hits us. When these clouds of charged matter reach our planet, they can wreak havoc in electrical systems. Previous sunstorms have resulted in large-scale power outages and the total loss of satellites.
An important indicator for solar activity is sunspots - darker areas that are a little cooler than the rest of the sun's surface. Scientists at the Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory in Carinthia, Austria, monitor sunspots every day. They send their observations to the World Data Centre of the Sunspot Index in Bruxelles, where other experts are trying to predict the sun's behaviour so they can forecast space weather.
'The Sun - Inferno in the Sky', presents the latest developments in solar science and offers fresh, unexpected and even controversial insights into the work of scientists all around the world.</desc>

    <title>I'M LIVE: S1 E212</title>
    <desc>Kim Hyun-chul on I'm LIVE - Part II. Joining us on this week's I'm LIVE is the Korean father of city pop - Kim Hyun-chul! Kim Hyun-chul made his debut in 1989 with the album, "Kim Hyun-chul Vol. 1." With all songs composed, written, and arranged by the artist himself, he pleasantly surprised the ears and souls of listeners with his jazz-infused music and eventually brought a new wave to the Korean music scene. Throughout his 32-year career, Kim Hyun-chul gained much critical acclaim and commercial success, earning the nickname the "father of Korean city pop." Also, his debut album was chosen as one of the All-Time 100 Greatest Albums of Korean Popular Music, thanks to the influence it had had on the Korean music scene. Then in 2019, Kim Hyun-chul resumed his career after a break of 13 years and in celebration of the 30th anniversary of his debut. The album garnered much attention not only because of the anticipation of fans and critics but also because he brought an array of Korea’s leading artists along with him. His return coincided with the resurgence of city pop in Korea, and he's back once again 2 years later in 2021 to continue with the momentum. Part II of Kim Hyun-chul's performance features "So Nice!!," "Drive," "In My Neighborhood," and "Fall of the Moon." Tune in to the show and meet the legend!</desc>

    <desc>When Lance is cast as the star in the new remake of the classic movie "Ned Knightly and the Golden Castle" he doesn't anticipate Jestro and his monsters invading the set and ruining his starring role. It's movie time!  Lance does something very Lance: he agrees to star in a movie about remake of a classic film in Knighton: "The Golden Castle."  While pillaging a village, Jestro and the Book of Monsters see a movie poster for "The Golden Castle" and the book says the legendary Golden Castle is filled with riches!  Jestro explains that it's just a dumb movie and that it's not real.  It's all based on a "script."  The Book, who's been shelved for many years, wants to eat the movie script to learn more about the modern world.  On the set of the movie, Lance has invited the other Knights to act as extras.  When they see how Lance is being portrayed, they're incensed.  When Jestro attacks the movie set to get the script for his book to eat, the film director keeps rolling.  This battle footage is fantastic!  The Knights defeat Jestro even though the movie set is trashed.  The director will make it work.  At the premier of the movie, Lance is embarrassed to see that he's been reduced to comic relief for the realm's bravest Knight...Macy!  The director has now made her a star.</desc>

Jestro, happy he has the REAL Book of Deception, uses it to create bad versions of the NEXO-Knights.  The "fake" knights then attack villages and hamlets.  When the real NEXO-Knights arrive, they're booed and pelted with food.  Why does everyone hate them?  To make matters more confusing, a giant Mech Suit in black - The BLACK KNIGHT - appears to defend the kingdom's villages from the fake knights.  The Black Knight ends up being very powerful and throws Jestro and his fake knights for a loop.  He's cool and mysterious.  But when the fake Knights get the better of him, the REAL NEXO-Knights appear to fend them off and learn their deceptive secret.  The Knights save the Black Knight and they open him up to find...young ROBIN!  (He used a deep, deceptive voice.)  The Knights realize that Robin has potential.

    <desc>The five friends leave for science camp that takes place on an island and during the trip, they meet the stand-offish Kate - but they soon realize that there's more to her than meets the eyes and that you shouldn't judge the book by its cover. No one is more excited than Olivia about science camp at a beautiful rocky offshore island with a lighthouse. But Olivia quickly gets off on the wrong foot with a mysterious girl named Kate who seems obsessed with a medallion necklace and the island's rumored history of pirates and treasure.  Even worse for Olivia, Kate seems to be growing extra chummy with Mia, even sneaking around the island with her late at night.  With the help of Stephanie, Emma and Andrea, Olivia is determined to get to the bottom of the girls' secret friendship and find out once and for all what they're searching for on the island, but they better not let Mrs. Stevens catch them out of their cabin past curfew.</desc>

    <title>The Book Of Total Badness - Episode 109</title>
    <desc>The NEXO-Knights must fight Jestro's Monsters of Destruction which are attacking all over the Kingdom.  But Merlok smells a trap...is he right? In a dark, destroyed part of the kingdom, Jestro arrives at the ruins of a HUGE castle.  The Book of Monsters knows this place: the great evil wizard Monstrux lived here.  The Book sniffs out some powerful magic in the ruins: "The Book of Destruction."  With this, The Book tells Jestro they can destroy the NEXO-Knights and then attack the King's Castle and cause massive destruction.  Jestro creates destructive monsters and sends them all over the realm, so the Knights must separate and fight single combats all over the place.  The Knights lose these battles (lesson: they have to work as a team!)  And, just when the Knights are scattered across the Kingdom, Jestro attacks the King's Castle!  It looks like all is lost.  When Aaron, who has escaped, returns to see Jestro's attack, he realizes he must gather his fellow Knights.  Merlok says it's very dangerous, but Aaron says he must take the risk to gather the Knights and save Knighton.</desc>

    <title>The Grand Hotel -  Episode 9</title>
    <desc>The five friends help out at The Grand Hotel that Andrea's family just bought during what was supposed to be a quiet weekend until a hotel critic arrives unexpectedly. The girls are ready to do everything to make a great impression - but things don't quite go according to plan. Andrea, Stephanie, Olivia, Emma and Mia have come for breakfast at the fanciest hotel in town, now owned by Andrea's family. When Andrea's aunt has to leave town, the girls volunteer to run the hotel for the weekend with the help of quirky Grandma Jean. This is the perfect job for Stephanie's expert managerial skills but then the hotel suddenly fills to capacity with guests, including a hotel critic that can make or break the hotel's reputation! Now the girls find themselves in over their heads juggling reception, childcare, food prep and waitressing, a dog-walking service and a testy chef who quits on them in the middle of dinner. Unfortunately, much of this is their own fault.  Can the girls save the Grand Hotel from themselves?</desc>

    <desc>Aaron races across the kingdom to gather the NEXO-Knights as Jestro and his Destructive Monsters attack the King's Castle.  The Knights must get back to the capitol in time, or Jestro will rule the kingdom! Jestro, while still attacking the King's Castle, has second thoughts until the Book of Monsters orders the mad jester to feed him another magic book he's found (and has been saving.)  It's the powerful "Book of Revenge!"  Now, combining the powers of Revenge and Destruction, Jestro and his monsters will get their vengeance on King Halbert and the Kingdom of Knighton.  Jestro and his monsters lay siege...will they destroy the castle?!  Meanwhile, Aaron races across the Kingdom gathering the NEXO-Knights one at a time.  As each Knight rejoins the group, they become a more and more powerful team.  They even get Robin to join them as the Black Knight in his repaired power suit.  Our Knights arrive, finally regrouped, fight off Jestro, save the castle and the King.  It's a glorious victory!  The King is so pleased after seeing how the brave NEXO-Knights saved his kingdom, he allows Macy to join them as an official NEXO-Knight.</desc>

    <title>Whale Adventures With Nigel Marven</title>
    <desc>"North to the Golden Gate" - The whales' journey takes them right up the coast of California, where the hustle and bustle of human activity is a stark contrast to the peace of the Mexican desert. Nigel takes a boat into the Santa Barbara channel to catch up with the greys as they swim past, and meets some even bigger whales, humpbacks, putting on an awe-inspiring acrobatic display. A little further out are the Channel Islands, protected havens for a huge variety of animals, both above and below the waves. Nigel plunges underwater to swim in the forests of kelp, and on the island of Santa Cruz he's led on a merry dance by a unique and diminutive fox.

Continuing north, the whales and the presenter pass Big Sur, an incredible landscape home to an incredible creature - the Californian condor. Like the grey whales, this rare bird came back from the brink of extinction thanks to conservation efforts. Travelling across the Golden Gate Bridge to the far north of the State, Nigel finishes his Californian adventure in Redwood National Park, among giant trees that have been alive since the time of Ancient Rome.</desc>

    <title>Wildlife Savers</title>
    <desc>Wildlife Savers is a documentary film about an extraordinary journey: 500 elephants will be moved to a new home in Malawi. This is one of the largest and most significant elephant translocations in human history. Due to poaching, habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, elephants are being decimated across Africa. 'Wildlife Savers' however, is a different story - one of hope and restoration and of securing the future for Malawi's elephants.

Although Malawi has a relatively peaceful history, the country sees increasing conflict between wildlife and people. Heavily armed poachers are prevalent, harvesting illegal ivory from the remaining elephants, which have been reduced by half from 4,000 to around 2,000 in only twenty years. The "Wildlife Savers" of African Parks resist the onslaught, committing their lives to stemming the violence. What enables them to persevere in their determination to bring about change? Will this, one of the largest elephant relocations in human history, be the solution for elephants and humans in the region?</desc>
