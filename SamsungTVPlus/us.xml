    <title>The Island with Bear Grylls</title>
    <desc>''Surviving The Island'' -In this special episode of The Island With Bear Grylls takes an in-depth look at life on the islands. 

On The Island, Bear conducted the ultimate survival challenge to see if 14 men and 14 women could survive for six weeks on an uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean. They were completely alone, filming everything themselves, with only a handful of basic tools and the clothes they stood up in. They not only had to survive entirely on their own wits for six gruelling weeks, but had to contend with the vicious tropical storm season.  

In this special episode Surviving The Island, Bear returns to meet the men and women who made it through the experiment and sees first hand  how they managed  to survive for the past six weeks. He hears their reflections on their time on the island and shares his thoughts on how they have coped with the extremes.</desc>

    <title>A Very Sordid Wedding</title>
    <desc>Seventeen years after family matriarch Peggy tripped over G.W.'s wooden legs in Sordid Lives, same-sex marriage equality has barreled into Winters, Texas and not everyone is ready to accept it. An anniversary memorial service is being planned in honor of Peggy at the bar while the Southside Baptist Church plans an "Anti-Equality" rally to protest the abomination of gay marriage and work to defend their religious freedom. The beloved cast of colorful characters are all on a collision course for shenanigans and fireworks on the big night. Along the way a bisexual serial killer shows up, a drag queen country medley is performed and a beauty-salon-versus-the-bigots battle turns getting your hair done into the front lines of the equality battle.  Friendships are tested and families are reunited as fear and bigotry are confronted with acceptance and understanding on the way to a surprise wedding with (almost) everyone in attendance.</desc>

    <desc>Learning to catch delicious yellowtail snapper doesn't have to be difficult. One of our favorite techniques to landing these fish, which have excellent eyesight, is using oat balls or oatmeal to cloud the water, get your bait past the blue runners and bait fish and hopefully start a feeding frenzy! In this video we go over targeting yellowtail snappers at the deep reef and also the shallow patch reefs. Just remember to always experiment with your jig sizes based on current! https://www.galeforcefishing.com</desc>

    <desc>The cobia migration is happening now and we want to show you our favorite ways to fish for and land these crab eating mud sharks! Our preferred method for targeting these fish is to anchor on a wreck in the Gulf of Mexico in at least 20 ft of water off the Florida Keys. We put out knocker rigs with pinfish and crabs, flat lines with pinfish and wire rigs with blue runners in case we hook into a kingfish or shark. This time of year we usually don't have to wait very long for a bite but if it's slow we will work on catching snappers and blue runners while waiting for that big fish</desc>

The term vegan was coined in 1944 by Donald Watson when he co-founded the Vegan Society in England. At first this meant non-dairy vegetarian and later the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals.</desc>

    <title>The Veteran's Special House Project | The Veteran's Special House Project</title>
    <desc>Over three special episodes, This Old House is partnering with Homes For Our Troops (HFOT) to build a houseäó_í‹í¬from the ground upäó_í‹í¬for one Army veteran and his family, as a way to highlight the heroes who have given so much for their country. In 2003, while on his first deployment to Iraq, SSG Matt Dewitt and his battalion came under attack, leaving Matt with devastating injuries that resulted in the amputation of both arms. We meet Matt and his family at his current home to understand the challenges of day-to-day and why a HFOT specially adapted home will be life changing. Kevin meets Buildings Project Manager Mike Duckett in Hopkinton, NH to see the plans for the DeWitt project. Norm, Tom and Kevin join builder Ken Dionne and his team to help with framing the exterior walls. Kevin meets the HFOT Chairman, Four Star General Richard Cody, to understand their mission. Kevin then travels to Florida to meet Justin Gaertner, another veteran who also received a specially adapted home from HFOT. Kevin rejoins the project in New Hampshire and finds that all the exterior walls are secured and the truss roof is going up.</desc>

    <title>Kingdom Of Heroes - Episode 210</title>
    <desc>The Book of Monsters, having the final pieces of his evil plan in place, tries to take human form.  Can the NEXO-Knights and Merlok 2.0 stop the greatest threat they've ever faced?  Or will the kingdom be plunged into darkness...forever. The Redoubt of Ruination readies the final ceremony to call forth MONSTRUX, the arch-necromancer of the past.  Clay, holding the Book of Betrayal walks to the gates of the spooky place.  Inside, Clay hears strange...singing and music.  It's like a twisted Broadway show of some kind.  Meanwhile, the Knights all realize Clay is gone and so is the Book of Betrayal.  Macy says Clay must be up to something.  They have to trust him and, more importantly, they have to find him.  At the Redoubt of Ruination the ceremony has already begun!  The Book of Monsters wants the final ceremony that calls forth Monstrux to be like a really great show!  The BOM then barfs up all the BOOKS OF EVIL into their places around Jestro.  He's just missing the BOOK OF BETRAYAL, which Clay has.  Clay says he'll trade the book for Jestro.  The BOM immediately agrees to the deal and sets Jestro free.  Then, Monsters grab-up Clay, restrain him, and put him in Jestro's place on the sacrifice stone.  From outside, they're interrupted by the sounds of battle  the Knights have arrived on the Fortrex and are attacking the Redoubt of Ruination.  In the confusion, Jestro slips away.  The BOM lets loose with a powerful protection spell to keep the Knights out as he starts with the ceremony...he's going to bring Monstrux out and remanifest him in Clay's body!  Jestro is able to escape the Redoubt and make his way to the Knights, who can't seem to battle their way in.  It's a race against time as the Knights try to get in and save Clay.  As the Knights get in, they see that the crazy BOM is absorbing all the Books of Evil, one-by-one.  He grows BIGGER and BIGGER!  Macy calls for NEXO-Power...but it's not enough!  The gigantic Book of Monsters sucks down the final book, the Book of Betrayal!  He looms over Clay, about to consume him, too, and make him into Monstrux!  Suddenly, Robin appears carrying TECHKALIBER...he tosses it to Clay.  Just as the huge Book of Monsters falls on Clay, he holds up Techkaliber and Merlok 2.0 is there...his full power in the sword.  Clay sticks the sword into the Book of Monster's huge mouth.  BOOM!  There's a BIG, MAGICAL EXPLOSION!  As we cut back inside, we see the Book of Monsters is gone.  The Knights release Clay and he thanks them and Jestro for saving him.  Jestro thanks them all for saving him and seeing the good in him.  WE DISSOLVE TO: The JoustDome.  In a final ceremony the King and Queen reward the knights and congratulate them for keeping the kingdom safe.  There are speeches, happiness and friendship.  And Jestro even does a bit that's funny.  At the very end we see a hint of something...Monstrux and the Book of Monsters are still out there.</desc>

    <title>The Last Voyage</title>
    <desc>The Ninjas, Lloyd, Sensei Wu and Misako journey to the Dark Island to find a 'Temple of Light' that can restore the Ninjas' elemental powers but are attacked by Starteeth (barnacle-like star fish) that start eating through their ship. The Stone Army and Lord Garmadon have disappeared, and our heroes can see the mysterious Dark Island off their coastline. Fearing Garmadon is up to no good, Sensei Wu has the whole team suit up to begin a journey to the Dark Island. Since the Bounty's engines are damaged, they plan to go by sea. Misako reveals her ancient scrolls state of a 'Temple of Light' that could return the Ninja's elemental powers, and it could be found on the island. Meanwhile, Lord Garmadon has the Army mining for more 'Dark Matter', using it to build a Super-Weapon that will recreate Ninjago in a twisted evil way. When a storm hits at sea, our heroes are attacked by Starteeth (barnacle-like starfish that can eat through a ship) and are forced to find refuge on a lighthouse at sea. Inside, Zane discovers his inventor father, the Tinkerer, is alive!  Together, they repair the Bounty so it can fly again, escaping a giant Leviathan, and soaring to the Dark Island ahead.</desc>

    <title>The Cloud - Episode 301</title>
    <desc>A storm is brewing over Knighton. Monstrox has taken the form of a cloud, and is raising an army of lightning infused Stone Monsters. His first target is the new Lavalands Amusement Park. Harmony reigns in Knighton as the Knights pursue their civilian lives: Lance has a TV talk show  Axl is the singing chef on the show  Jestro is the weatherman  Clay is teaching at the Knights' Academy  Macy, Ava and Merlok 2.0 travel the land in the Fortrex making sure the kingdom's defenses are ready (part of a plan she and Clay have)  Aaron and his hover shield is travelling the land setting extreme records. Robin is at his workshop at the Knights' Academy doing an "independent study" - he's working on some top secret project for Merlok 2.0. It all seems excellent! We even see the Knights new vehicles - which have been optimized for civilian life (except for Clay's.) But storm clouds are brewing. Well, one storm cloud is brewing: the Cloud of Monstrox! Yes, the Book of Monsters has reconstituted himself and is now a cloud who needs a man on the ground to enact his new evil plan. He follows his old buddy Jestro as he goes across the realm on the weekends apologizing for being evil. ZAP! With one bolt of his evil magic lighting, the Cloud of Monstrox turns Jestro evil again (only this time a bit, well, too evil.) The evil duo are back together - and bring stone to life for the first time in the form of Gargoyles from the town of GHOULIA. Now they must gather the Forbidden Powers so that the Cloud of Monstrox can destroy the entire kingdom! A battle breaks out in the Lava Lands, where Lance and Alice Squires are reporting from the opening of the Cuthbert Richmond funded Lava Lands Amusement Park, rebuilt from the remains of Jestro's old HQ. Jestro and the Cloud are after something in the remains and as Merlok 2.0 sends out a call for the Knights to help Lance. Can Lance (with an assist from King Halbert in his Mech) hold-off Jestro, the Cloud and their new army of stone fighters?!</desc>

    <title>The Island Of Darkness</title>
    <desc>After battling off Garmadon's Stone Army, the Ninjas finally arrive at the Temple of Light where they harness their pure elemental powers, concentrating them onto Lloyd who becomes more powerful than he ever imagined. The Ninja camouflage the Bounty, creating a secret rebel base on the island. Misako says they must find the Temple of Light, because only when their elemental powers return, will they be strong enough to defeat the indestructible Stone Army. The Ninja search the dark, exotic island and come across Garmadon's compound, where they're building the Super-Weapon. The Ninja discover the Temple of Light is hidden at the highest peak of the island, and the Tinkerer aids their trek in creating a Drill Dozer so they can travel underground unnoticed. A final chase and battle takes place at the Temple of Light, as the Ninja solve the puzzle and harness their pure elemental powers, concentrating them onto Lloyd, who also becomes more powerful then he ever imagined. Their new abilities can destroy the indestructible Stone Warriors. Although Lord Garmadon finds this to be a setback, the Overlord reassures him darkness will prevail, as we end on seeing the Celestial Clock ticking down closer to zero.</desc>

    <title>A Little Rusty - Episode 302</title>
    <desc>The Cloud of Monstrox and Jestro unlocks a mysterious Forbidden Power. What kind ofhavoc will they unleash? And can Merlok 2.0 and the NEXO KNIGHTS make the new COMBO NEXO Powers  work? The Knights finally make it to the Lava Lands - using their various new forms of transport, which are all strictly civilian vechicles - and they must regroup and learn to fight together again to face the new threat of Jestro, the Cloud of Monstrox, and their STONE MONSTERS (in this case, Stone Gargoyles.) But Jestro and his monsters beat back the knights and recover the STAFF OF MONSTROX - which was buried under the ceremonial chamber from Episode 210 (and is now the Lava Puker amusement park ride) - and they get away on Jestro's EVIL MOBILE, which he recovers from the HQ garage. Macy says this is exactly why she's been touring the kingdom preparing everyone for the next attack. The Knights have to get it together because now the entire kingdom is under threat...again. Robin decides he must upgrade the Knights' vehicles and make them more "fight optimized." Ava and Merlok 2.0 must figure out how to use new NEXO Powers because regular NEXO Powers do make Stone monsters back into stone, but the Cloud simply zaps them to life again. Meanwhile, in the IRON MOUNTAINS, Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox find the first of the Forbidden Powers: RELENTLESS RUST. They find the ROGUL STATUE holding the power and zap him to life. Now...they can rust those shiny knights to pieces! Ava and Merlok are attempting to use NEXO COMBO POWERS - with hilarious results - as they try to figure out how they might work. When Jestro attacks, he's able to halt the Fortrex by instantly rusting its tracks and wheels! Robin has his hands full trying to clean all the rust from the attack of Relentless Rust. As the Knights attempt to defend against Jestro, the Cloud is zapping statues to life. He hits a statue with a bolt of lightning as Clay is touching it. Something happens...Clay feels odd  stiff  as if rock is mixing with his body. Finally, Ava and Merlok 2.0 download to the Knights their new thing: a COMBO NEXO COMBO Power. It works! It can smash the animated statues to dust! They use it to defeat Jestro, but he and the Cloud get away with the Forbidden Power of Relentless Rust. Victory ... sort of. Clay talks to Merlok 2.0...something has happened to him. What can they do? Merlok 2.0 is very concerned.</desc>

    <title>The Last Hope</title>
    <desc>When the Ninjas' attempt to return Garmadon's 'Helmet of Darkness' to its perch at the Celestial Clock in order to prevent the final battle between Lloyd and his father from beginning fails, a Super Weapon is created that can destroy all of Ninjago. With the Overlord and Garmadon nearing completion of the Super-Weapon, Misako tells the group she thinks there could be one last chance at preventing Lloyd's final battle with his father. She believes if they can steal the helmet off Garmadon's head and return it to it's rightful perch on the Celestial Clock, it could stop the clock before it reaches zero, thus preventing the final battle from beginning. Dressed as Warriors, the Ninja escort their 'captive' Misako to Garmadon, and the heroes see glimpses of the Super-Weapon being built. In a thrilling escape, Misako cleverly steals Garmadon's helmet, and they race to the Celestial Clock. Lloyd has a brief encounter with his father, and hesitates striking him. When they return the helmet to its rightful perch, they're one second too late, allowing the clock to reach zero, and for it to focus a beam of concentrated light from the sky into the Super-Weapon. Nya is taken hostage, as the others fall off a cliff, barely surviving the fall. The Ninja have failed -- the final battle has begun.</desc>

    <title>Thunderstox - Episode 303</title>
    <desc>Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox encounters the sculptor. He helps unleash a horde of fierce garden gnomes on Knighton. What will the NEXO KNIGHTS do against this new enemy? Will their new COMBO NEXO Powers do the trick? As Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox head off on the Evil Mobile to 'store' the Forbidden Power in a secret location, they encounter...THE SCULPTOR. His real name is ROBERTO ARNOLDI. He's a sensitive and odd artist who has been laid off by the king (the King ordered a "smashing" statue of the Queen, and the Sculptor made a statue of the Queen literally smashing monsters. He takes everything very literally.) Jestro instructs him to make a "bad" statue that he can use to attack the knights. The Sculptor sets to work. Meanwhile, the NEXO KNIGHTS are discussing the COMBO NEXO Powers, the Forbidden Powers, and what all this means. Lance, meanwhile, decides that since his talk show career is on hold, he thinks he'll install cameras in the Fortrex and do a Big Brother-like expose show on the Knights (he decides NOT to tell the others.) Merlok 2.0 and the Cloud of Monstrox (each talking to their cohorts) explain the history of the Forbidden Powers: it's a history lesson about the WIZARDS' COUNCIL, the Forbidden Powers, and how they were stopped long ago. This visual montage leads Jestro to...MOUNT THUNDERSTROX. The Cloud of Monstrox shows him the circle of ten Standing Stones where he will insert the Forbidden Powers. "What'll happen after that?" asks Jestro, curious. "Oh, I don't want to spoil the surprise," says the Cloud. They insert the first Forbidden Power, Relentless Rust, and it locks into place on its stone. They go off to battle the Knights and collect the "bad" statue the sculptor is making. But he's made a literally bad statue...it's terrible ... garden gnomes. Like an amateur art student. And...it's not even finished. ("You can't rush bad genius!") The Knights attack with their newly modified vehicles and they succeed in destroying the Evil Mobile. They then try to use a COMBO NEXO Power, but can't...it had to be perfect to work (Ava and Merlok need to work on it.) As Jestro and the Cloud retreat, Merlok again talks to Clay about turning to stone! Merlok calls in Robin...he will need him to build something to help Clay as he becomes more and more impaired.</desc>

    <title>Return Of The Overlord</title>
    <desc>When Garmadon uses his new Super-Weapon to turn Jamakai Village evil, he unwittingly unsettles the balance, allowing the spirit of the Overlord to cross over and possesses his body. Lord Garmadon witnesses the Super-Weapon come to life, revealing it to be 'Garma-Tron', a giant moving cannon. His first test subject is Nya. Meanwhile, the heroes prepare for the final battle and sneak-attack Garmadon's compound...only to find it empty. The Super-Weapon is moving towards the coastline, where the cannon's range can reach Ninjago. On the way there, the Ninja must face off with Evil Nya, turned dark from the Super-Weapon. On the coastline, Lloyd battles his father atop Garma-Tron. The battle is fierce, but Lloyd fails at stopping his father from firing Garma-Tron, turning Jamanakai Village evil. Garmadon naively celebrates, not realizing he's undone the balance, allowing the spirit of the Overlord to cross over and possess his body. And as the Overlord continues to get more powerful, a hideous metamorphosis is taking place. Lloyd must fight the Overlord, and just when it looks like good will prevail, Lloyd is injured and thrown to the ground. In the end, the villains escape through a portal to Ninjago, and our heroes are abandoned on the island with no way home. And with the Green Ninja injured, it looks like all is lost. Evil has won.</desc>

    <title>Rotten Luck - Episode 304</title>
    <desc>Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox unleashes the Forbidden Power Ravaging Rot on Knighton! Turning everything into green gooey rot. But Robin has an awesome new invention that could help the NEXO KNIGHTS Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox find a second Forbidden Power near the falling down Swamp Castle: RAVAGING ROT. With this power, they can make everything in the kingdom rot - food, vegetation, anything that grows or is natural. And that's exactly what they do! It's awful and makes everything stink. The Sculptor start to sculpt a portable HeadQuarter for his master, Jestro. Jestro expects it to be done when they return from ravaging the land. Axl is very concerned - he's into organic food ... and now food starts to rot. Merlok 2.0 and Ava are continuing to work on perfecting the COMBO NEXO Powers. We see display screens of MANY of the NEXO Powers. But there's a huge power consumption issue with these new-fangled combos. "I'll have to find an algorithmic power curve consumption solution, magic man," says Ava. "I always just sort of choose them by, uh, feel." "What do you feel like?" "Uh, a ham sandwich, a banana, and dragon fire," responds Merlok. "That produced a combo with 2% efficiency," says Ava. "This is why we have to actually THINK about and study perfec Combos. We need automatic power integration." The Knights must stop Jestro from rotting all the food and living plant matter in Knighton and Axl leads the charge. But as they finally confront Jestro, who's trying to rot a field of beans near Fruitbridge, they're hit by his finally completed ROLLING HQ (the Sculptor is proud of the "artsy" elements.) ... it's not exactly perfect though ... he took the idea of Head Quarter a little too litteral and created a big head. Finally, in this conclusive battle where the knights get strapped on a rotting bridge, Clay emerges in a sleek, new BATTLE SUIT that Robin built for him because he was starting to have trouble moving around (the whole turning to stone thing.) It's smaller and more high-tech than the bigger Mechs of the past. Clay's able to drive Jestro off. Jestro, at the end of the episode, puts the Forbidden Power of Ravaging Rot into Mount Thunderstrox. Meanwhile, back at the Fortrex, Axl makes an organic food feast for all his fellow Knights.</desc>

While Jestro roams the halls fo the King's Castle, forlorn, he hears the BOOK OF MONSTERS calling to him from Merlok's library. The book talks Jestro into gathering as many books of spells as he can carry, but they're interrupted by...Clay! As Jestro quickly pages through the Book of Monsters to attack Clay, Merlok arrives. There's a battle in the library between Jestro and Merlok. Finally, the wizard summons up his most powerful spell in self-defence. BOOM!

Then Macy remembers her dad has a royal RV...maybe they can "mod" that for their own, "knightly" use? Now the NEXO-Knights get rolling...in THE FORTREX, their own ROLLING CASTLE!  This great new HQ, which houses Merlok 2.0 as an operating system, will be how the knights move around Knighton and protect it from Jestro and his monsters.  Speaking of the evil jester, in this episode Jestro uses some newly-made monsters to attack a town far from the capitol where he thinks he's safe from the Knights' reach.  We see two parallel stories here: the Knights training, learning more about digital magic and getting organized as a team and at the same time we see Jestro making monsters, trying to learn how his powers work and talking to the Book.  In the end, the Knights roll up in their castle and defeat Jestro and his marauding monsters.  Lance thinks he should be the leader because he's a snot. "Of course I'm the leader...I'm a Richmond."</desc>

    <desc>Using the Book of Fear, Jestro calls forth Whipperella and uses her to trap the knights in the dark woods where they realize their darkest fears. Searching through the dark forests of the realm, Jestro finds "The Book of Fear."   It's pretty scary.

Macy fears never being a knight and Axl fears having no food.  Aaron must take the lead because he's fearless  he does everything with reckless abandon.  It's not until he leads the group out of the forest - as they fight off the Whipperella - that they we find out Aaron's true fear - the fear of peace and quiet and no more challenges or high energy escapades.</desc>

    <title>Wildlife Savers</title>
    <desc>Wildlife Savers is a documentary film about an extraordinary journey: 500 elephants will be moved to a new home in Malawi. This is one of the largest and most significant elephant translocations in human history. Due to poaching, habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, elephants are being decimated across Africa. 'Wildlife Savers' however, is a different story - one of hope and restoration and of securing the future for Malawi's elephants.

Although Malawi has a relatively peaceful history, the country sees increasing conflict between wildlife and people. Heavily armed poachers are prevalent, harvesting illegal ivory from the remaining elephants, which have been reduced by half from 4,000 to around 2,000 in only twenty years. The "Wildlife Savers" of African Parks resist the onslaught, committing their lives to stemming the violence. What enables them to persevere in their determination to bring about change? Will this, one of the largest elephant relocations in human history, be the solution for elephants and humans in the region?</desc>

    <title>Wildest Survival (Series 2)</title>
    <desc>"Animal Oddities" - Explore the complex world of supersize species. For nature's giants, being the biggest brings huge advantages - and enormous challenges. From massive land mammals to ocean behemoths, how nature's giants overcome life's big problems is awe inspiring. Whether it's finding ways to move their massive bodies, survive in extreme environments, or feed giant appetites, these animals have learned to use their size in extraordinary ways to survive. This colossal episode will feature epic battles in the frozen wilderness, reveal the world's largest living organism and take us deep into Europe's wild alpine forests to witness big beasts do battle. In a forgotten corner of the Amazon we meet highly sociable giant otters that rule their complex river systems. In the Australian outback, we bounce across the desert with the kangaroos that have a highly unusual approach to keeping their large frames cool. In Malaysia we come face to face with one of the worlds biggest insects, super strong beetles that can lift 850 times their own body weight. And on the edge of the Sahara we travel with elephants that can hear the approach of a storm - and water - from hundreds of kilometres away. These are just some of the species featured in this Episode - natures giants that have found astonishing solutions to life's biggest problems.</desc>
