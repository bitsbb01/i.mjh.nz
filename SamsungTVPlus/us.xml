    <desc>"Crane Cannon Launch/Trash Scavenger Hunt/Heli Body Drag" - This episode featured four pairs as teams. First, it's the human cannonball. As a truck drives along a pier with a crane hanging off the side, one team member hangs from a crane and then into the water they light the fuse to giant cannon. Their partner is shot out of the cannon and into the water, swim to a boat and clip a flag to a flagpole. The team to finish fastest chooses team to be eliminated. Next, it's a trash can buffet scavenger hunt. Teams dig through dumpsters and barrels to find items. The team to match four items fastest would win a four-day trip to Las Vegas and $20,000. No one would be eliminated. The final stunt is a real drag. Team members hanging on to handlebars attached to a helicopter and are dragged across pavement on their stomachs. They have to let go as close to the finish line as possible. The team to get the least combined distance from the finish line would win $50K. The home invasion stunt goes to Dubuque, Iowa.</desc>

    <title>Dad's Having A Baby</title>
    <desc>Born as Jessica and Laura, Tom and Scott each came from traditional families. Now gay men, they met at their local Lesbian, Gay Bi Transgender group and fell in love. With Tom's two adopted sons, Logan and Greg, along with two dogs, two cats, a turtle and a puffer fish, the Moores were a blissfully happy family. Like most married couples, Scott and Tom still wanted to try for a baby, but unlike most male couples, they had the means to do so, as Scott still had working female reproductive organs.</desc>

    <title>Mama Rainbow</title>
    <desc>For Chinese parents, finding out that their kid is gay usually presents a major tragedy, with many utterly unable to accept their children's sexuality. During recent years however, a fresh rainbow wind has been blowing over the Chinese mainland: a pioneer generation of Chinese parents have been stepping up and speaking out on their love for their gay kids. "Mama Rainbow" features 6 mothers from all over China, who talk openly and freely about their experiences with their homosexual children. With their love, they are giving a whole new definition to Chinese-style family bonds.</desc>

    <title>Drag Kids</title>
    <desc>Drag has always been about breaking down barriers and daring to do the unexpected. Now, a new type of queen is on the scene: she's fierce, she's living in a time of unprecedented access to queer culture, and she's younger than ever before. She's a drag kid and she's a long way from the era of the queens who led the Stonewall Riots nearly 50 years ago. Stephan, Jason, Bracken and Nemis have never met, but they're united by a shared passion for drag. They are about to come together for the first time - to perform Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' at the world-famous Montreal Pride Festival. As they prepare for the big show, each faces their own unique challenges, as well as challenges they have in common - deep feelings of isolation and the struggle of trying to claim a place of your own on the fringes of a fringe culture. Drag Kids is a beautiful, daring, and touching portrait of four kids chasing freedom and friendship through the art of drag.</desc>

    <title>The Library</title>
    <desc>As we seek to honor and celebrate the countless LGBTQ individuals, communities, sub-communities, and dynasties that have flourished in the face of adversity over decades, it dawned on us that there are so many unknown and untold stories about gay history, vocabulary, vernacular, and the human experiences that fuel the formation of cultures and identities based on authentic self-expression and love. As we discovered these stories, we wished for a gay "library" where anyone could visit and learn, in bite-size portions, about crucial events in gay history, gay heroes and icons past and present, fascinating sub-cultures, slang terms, scientific references, political movements... Essentially, a record of all the bits of queer education that are at risk of being lost or misinterpreted — information that we all crave as members of LGBTQ communities and as Allies. Do you know the story of the first Pride parade? Ever wondered what "Skoliosexual," "Polycule," or "Doppelbanger" means? The Library is open — and ready to clue you in.</desc>

    <title>Charlestown 2014 | 35 Years of This Old House</title>
    <desc>In celebration of 35 years of This Old House, we look back at all that's changed in the last 35 years, and also what hasn't: our commitment to delivering trusted ideas and information to empower homeowners. This season begins in Boston's oldest neighborhood, Charlestown. Kevin and Norm highlight Charlestown's historical importance, from colonial times through WWII. Our new project is part of a cluster of 1850s-era Greek Revival houses tucked into the backside of Bunker Hill. Homeowner Angela Daigle shows Kevin the period feel and features of her home that she loves, but also the outdated kitchen and poor organization of space that she'd like to improve. Upstairs, Tom Silva shows Norm the spaces that will be getting minimal work: an existing guest room, guest bath, and living room. But one level up, on the third floor, it will likely be a full gut to give Angela a better master suite with additional living space, assuming the City approves the plan to enlarge the existing dormers. Out back, Roger shows Kevin the sad state of the crumbling retaining walls. Then Kevin finds Richard formulating a plan for the basement. Norm stops in next door to meet Maggie Boone to see how she recently addressed a lot of the same issues that Angela faces by renovating her own row house. And Norm and Tom test for lead paint before beginning demo on the first floor, as downstairs, Kevin, Richard and mason Mark McCullough start digging into the project.</desc>

    <title>Charlestown 2014 | Brick Rowhouse Blues</title>
    <desc>Kevin arrives to find Tom solving a major problem with the house: The exterior walls are bowing out from the weight of the roof over 160 years. His solution: build a structural wall inbound of the brick, lash the brick to the structure with threaded rods and epoxy, and then parge the whole thing. In the basement, news is brighter: Richard shows Kevin the result of two weeks of hand digging and a week of rough plumbing. The floor is down several inches, the sewer line tucked neatly in the floor, and the radiant heat/insulation system is currently going in. On the third floor, Norm shows Kevin how the roof has been under-structured since it was originally built. The structure they added in the 1980s helped, but it still needs more. Tom joins to get the first of two massive LVLs tucked into the pockets in the brick sidewalls, and fastened in place. To see how it's holding up, Norm revisits the townhouse we renovated in Charlestown 14 years ago. Back at our house, Tom shows Kevin how he's going to open up the back wall for the new bump out. It starts with using two temporary steel "needles" through the reinforced rear wall to hold the weight of the house while a new steel beam is inserted. Then, the bricks can come down one by one to make a small new addition for the breakfast area.</desc>

    <title>Charlestown 2014 | A Bridge to Charlestown</title>
    <desc>Richard gets up close and personal with one of Charlestown's most iconic structures-the Zakim Bridge-by talking with the structural engineer on the project, Ted Zoli. At the project house, Kevin finds the front of the building obscured by scaffolding  it will be used to replace the failing asphalt roof, and also to build the dormer, if approval comes in from the City. Inside, Tom shows Kevin how he'll have to modify the old chimney for the new gas fireplace units, and they see the framing progress, including the new bump out for the breakfast area. The third floor master suite is all framed up, save the dormer, which is still in regulatory limbo. In the backyard, mason Mark McCullough presents options for rebuilding the decaying retaining walls at different price points. Then, they dig into the demolition, carrying all of the old wall material out through the house, by hand. Norm visits a salvage yard in Boston's South End that has dozens of architectural elements from the Greek Revival period, including a marble mantel and some glass doorknobs that are perfect for Angela's house. Several days later, Mark starts installing the homeowner's choice for the retaining wall: an interlocking concrete system with a bluestone cap. Richard shows Kevin the progress on the rough plumbing and electrical, including a high velocity mini duct system that will pair with an electric inverter heat pump unit to supply either air handlers or high wall cassette units. It's an efficient and quiet solution, which is perfect for this close-knit City location.</desc>

    <title>I'M LIVE: S1 E216</title>
    <desc>Joining us on this week's I'm LIVE is singer Sam Kim! This artist made himself known to the public in 2013 as the runner-up of the popular talent show "K-pop Star Season 3." Then he made his official debut in 2016 and has been mesmerizing listeners with his velvety voice and songwriting skills since then. Thanks to his outstanding musicality, he has also worked with a number of A-list musicians, including IU, Crush, Zico, and more. In June this year, Sam Kim released his new single "The Juice" after a break of about 2 years. With a blend of retro pop and hip hop, this autobiographic song depicts his worn-out state of mind interestingly through groovy dance moves. So he has proved that he can sing, compose, and even dance, making us eagerly anticipate what more he has in store for us. In this episode, Sam Kim performs "The Juice," "Make Up," "Seattle" and more to showcase the quintessence of his artistry. Tune in to I'm LIVE and meet this talented singer!</desc>

    <title>The Golden Castle - Episode 106</title>
    <desc>When Lance is cast as the star in the new remake of the classic movie "Ned Knightly and the Golden Castle" he doesn't anticipate Jestro and his monsters invading the set and ruining his starring role. It's movie time!  Lance does something very Lance: he agrees to star in a movie about remake of a classic film in Knighton: "The Golden Castle."  While pillaging a village, Jestro and the Book of Monsters see a movie poster for "The Golden Castle" and the book says the legendary Golden Castle is filled with riches!  Jestro explains that it's just a dumb movie and that it's not real.  It's all based on a "script."  The Book, who's been shelved for many years, wants to eat the movie script to learn more about the modern world.  On the set of the movie, Lance has invited the other Knights to act as extras.  When they see how Lance is being portrayed, they're incensed.  When Jestro attacks the movie set to get the script for his book to eat, the film director keeps rolling.  This battle footage is fantastic!  The Knights defeat Jestro even though the movie set is trashed.  The director will make it work.  At the premier of the movie, Lance is embarrassed to see that he's been reduced to comic relief for the realm's bravest Knight...Macy!  The director has now made her a star.</desc>

A talent show has come to Heartlake City and all the girls enter the talent competition hoping to impress the judges, especially their idol, pop star Chloe.  No one wants a shot at stardom more than Andrea, which is why the other girls are surprised when she doesn't show up to practice before the first round of the competition. Very nearly eliminated prior to the big show, Andrea panics and throws herself into an intense practice-training mode, even shutting her friends out when they're trying to help her with her performance. Just moments before her live TV debut, Andrea realizes she's missing a key element to her act. Can she pull it off without her friends?

    <desc>It seems the NEXO-Knights are attacking villages throughout the realm!  But why?  A mysterious Black Knight appears to defend the cities from the rogue NEXO-villains! Jestro, happy he has the REAL Book of Deception, uses it to create bad versions of the NEXO-Knights.  The "fake" knights then attack villages and hamlets.  When the real NEXO-Knights arrive, they're booed and pelted with food.  Why does everyone hate them?  To make matters more confusing, a giant Mech Suit in black - The BLACK KNIGHT - appears to defend the kingdom's villages from the fake knights.  The Black Knight ends up being very powerful and throws Jestro and his fake knights for a loop.  He's cool and mysterious.  But when the fake Knights get the better of him, the REAL NEXO-Knights appear to fend them off and learn their deceptive secret.  The Knights save the Black Knight and they open him up to find...young ROBIN!  (He used a deep, deceptive voice.)  The Knights realize that Robin has potential.  But maybe he still has some learning to do.</desc>

    <desc>The NEXO-Knights must fight Jestro's Monsters of Destruction which are attacking all over the Kingdom.  But Merlok smells a trap...is he right? In a dark, destroyed part of the kingdom, Jestro arrives at the ruins of a HUGE castle.  The Book of Monsters knows this place: the great evil wizard Monstrux lived here.  The Book sniffs out some powerful magic in the ruins: "The Book of Destruction."  With this, The Book tells Jestro they can destroy the NEXO-Knights and then attack the King's Castle and cause massive destruction.  Jestro creates destructive monsters and sends them all over the realm, so the Knights must separate and fight single combats all over the place.  The Knights lose these battles (lesson: they have to work as a team!)  And, just when the Knights are scattered across the Kingdom, Jestro attacks the King's Castle!  It looks like all is lost.  When Aaron, who has escaped, returns to see Jestro's attack, he realizes he must gather his fellow Knights.  Merlok says it's very dangerous, but Aaron says he must take the risk to gather the Knights and save Knighton.</desc>

When Andrea's aunt has to leave town, the girls volunteer to run the hotel for the weekend with the help of quirky Grandma Jean. This is the perfect job for Stephanie's expert managerial skills but then the hotel suddenly fills to capacity with guests, including a hotel critic that can make or break the hotel's reputation! Now the girls find themselves in over their heads juggling reception, childcare, food prep and waitressing, a dog-walking service and a testy chef who quits on them in the middle of dinner. Unfortunately, much of this is their own fault.  Can the girls save the Grand Hotel from themselves?</desc>

The Knights must get back to the capitol in time, or Jestro will rule the kingdom!

    <title>Back To School - Episode 201</title>
    <desc>When the NEXO-Knights are sloppy in a fight with Jestro, Merlok 2.0 sends them back to the Knights' Academy.  Not only for a brush-up but to find out what Jestro is after in its hallowed halls. As they Knights battle Jestro - in a somewhat haphazard and lazy way - they discuss the fact that Jestro never wins and that they're always getting over on him.  Despite defeating the jerky Jester and his evil Book, Merlok 2.0 discovers that something about the attack on the village is tied to the Knights' Academy. It looks like that's where they'll strike next.  It wouldn't hurt for the Knights to go "back to school" to watch for Jestro and for some refresher training.  Merlok is sure Jestro wants something at the Academy, but he doesn't know what it is.  The Knights are very much "fish out of water" at the academy, even with the "cool kids" - Robin and Ava - showing them around.  The next generation of Knights is being taught to integrate the NEXO-Magic of Merlok into their fighting techniques and these kids are good (so good, they initially kick the lazy, know-it-all Knight's butts!)  Their old principal, the ever-ornery Headmaster Brickland, sets them straight: they're all still slackers, and they better get their acts together (especially Lance!)  The Knights take shifts as "library helpers" much to the delight of the old squirebot librarian, MARGE.  They're convinced Jestro is after a book...isn't he always after a book?   When Jestro attacks, the Knights help organize the students and there's a big fight in the Academy Library versus Jestro and his Monsters.  They drive Jestro off without letting him steal any books!  Victory!  But as Jestro leaves, we see him holding what the Book of Monsters really wanted: a snow globe with a castle in it that was sitting on the librarian's desk. In the Lava Lands, Jestro throws the snow globe into a volcano and it frees the massive Castle of Monstrux from its snowy magic prison</desc>

    <title>Greed Is Good? - Episode 202</title>
    <desc>When Jestro uses the Book of Greed to rob Auremville of its riches, he also gets Lance's parents as prisoners and these demanding rich folks are too much for even monsters to handle. Jestro's not sure what to do with his new castle in the Lava Lands.  "Every castle needs a big chamber filled with treasure" says the Book of Monsters so they've got to go out looting!  The BOM convinces Jestro to call forth GENERAL MAGMAR, and Jestro appoints him as "general manager" of "castle operations," much to Magmar's dismay.  Meanwhile, Jestro and the BOM find the BOOK OF GREED.  This will allow them to make greedy, rapacious monsters that will bring them all the treasure they want to fill their castle!  They'll head to the richest town in the realm - AUREMVILLE!  Meanwhile, in Auremville, the NEXO-Knights arrive for a huge "Gold is Good" ball at Lance's house.  When the Monsters finally arrive in Auremville, a battle breaks out and the greedy monsters make off with everything...including Lance's parents, Goldie and Cuthbert Richmond who are clad in the finest golden garments and so look valuable!  Lance will now be forced to live...poor.  The Knights have to get his parents back.  Meanwhile, his parents - Cuthbert and Goldie Richmond -think their imprisonment in Jestro's gold-filled castle is a "spa holiday" with the worst service.  They order Magmar and the monsters around like servants and drive them all crazy.  The Knights pile into the Fortrex and head for the Lava Lands, formulating a plan along the way to free Lance's parents.  In a village half-way to Jestro's Castle, the Knights run into...Jestro and his monsters headed the other way with Lance's parents and all the gold they've stolen.  There's a big fight, until they realize they might have the same goal and decide to deal.  The BOM wants to give them back all the gold and Lance's parents.  Lance says "No deal."  "We'll take the gold, you can keep my parents."  It's a weird and comical stand-off.  Finally, Clay convinces Lance he has to take his parents back even if they don't always get along (and, it's the only way to get the gold back.)</desc>

    <title>The Book Of Obsession - Episode 203</title>
    <desc>The Knights are tasked with protecting the King's valuable Ned Knights comic book during the Bookingheim Knight-a-Con.  But with all the costumed kids there, will they recognize the real Jestro and Book of Monsters coming to get them? King Halbert instructs the Knights that they must take his valuable Ned Knights comic book to the "Knight-a-Kon" in Bookingham. It will be the first be first prize at the Knight-a-Kon.  But the Book of Monsters wants the book, too. Having devoured Ned Knightly comic books in it's down time it has become fanatically obsessed with the storyline.  General Magmar suggests they simply attack the place and take what they want, but Jestro tells them they can't: everyone will be in costume and they'll be thousands of comics there.  This calls for a clever "infiltration" mission (which will also allow Jestro to see the Kon, which he's always wanted to do.)   So Jestro goes into the Kon with the BOM and some monsters.  And it's easy because everyone is in costume  Jestro, the BOM and their monsters fit right in at the convention and Clay and crew have their work cut out for them trying to separate fiend from fan. Macy keeps going on-and-on about the story in the King's comic book as the Knights keep a watchful eye on it.  Robin even shows up in the "Minitrex" - a small version of the Fortrex he built just for the Knight-a-Kon.  He's convinced he can win the costume competition that is the big closing event for the Kon.  At the end of the Kon there's a big awards ceremony for "Best Costume."  The prize: "Ned Knightly, Knight of Knighton, Issue #1."  The BOM must get it and scheme to get closer to it during the costume contest.  He's just...about...to get the book when...the impatient Magmar attacks!  Everyone thinks it's part of the big show!  "Ned Knightly, Knight of Knighton, Issue #1" is tossed from person-to-person-to-person in the melee.  The Knights must do something, but they're too far away from the Fortrex to download any NEXO-Power.  Robin pulls up in his Minitrex  they can use it to get NEXO-Power!  Robin wins the best costume for his Minitrex and wins the Ned Knightly Comic which he then gives to Macy...she deserves to read it.</desc>
