    <desc>Dalton (Patrick Swayze) drives a Mercedes Benz, holds a degree in philosophy from NYU and makes lots of money. He's been shot at, stabbed and has broken most of the bones in his body. He also has a flip side - he's the best bar bouncer in the business. When Dalton's brought in to clean up a popular establishment that has become particularly rowdy, his calm is put to the test by the nasty local kingpin (Ben Gazzara) in this throwback to the great westerns of the 40s and 50s.</desc>

To combat lingering adverse publicity, the Delos corporation has offered two reporters (Peter Fonda, Blythe Danner) exclusive rights to the "new" Delos story. But as the reporters start their private tour, they get the feeling that the resort may not be as safe as Delos claims...</desc>

    <desc>Ian Harvie is not quite the kind of man you might think. He's redefining what it means to be a dude through a fresh perspective on sex/sexuality with some seriously funny and new kinds of dick jokes. Unafraid to quip about subjects no other comedian has ever touched, Ian's performance challenges the traditionally macho, sex-obsessed world of stand up in ways you won't believe, proving that laughter cuts across all identities and ultimately unites us all in MAY THE BEST C--K WIN. Oh and, Ian is the world's first trans man comedian with a stand up comedy special.

With an early opener, it offers us the opportunity to chase early season bucks before they shed their velvet. The crew settles into camp “Dinkota” and it didn’t take long for Aaron “JP” to break the ice and get the 2019 party started.</desc>

With a massive early season cold front opportunity, Dylan and JP packed up in Wisconsin to meet them at camp. Brennen and Dylan were in the hot seat this trip as Mike and JP had already notched their tags in the state. Anticipation was high, and for good reason. As the sun began to fall, Dylan would strike first and less than 20 miles away, Brennen would send an arrow to complete the double.</desc>

    <title>Chicken in a Skillet</title>

    <title>Lexington Colonial | Colonial Curb Appeal</title>
    <desc>At the Lexington project, Kevin finds the front gable wall of the second floor up, and the roof framing underway. Around back, Tom installs a 24-foot long LVL to temporarily hold up the second floor while he adds new structure. Then, they frame the rest of the addition roof. Nearby in Lexington's historic district, architect Frank Shirley shows Norm how people have been using front porches to lend character and charm to Colonial style homes for hundreds of years. Back at our house, Tom shows Kevin the framing of our new farmer's porch and then they build a small overhang to extend the look across the garage. Inside, Kevin sees how the homeowners are getting by without a kitchen, which has been gutted and is ready to be expanded thanks to a 24-foot steel beam that will carry the weight of the second floor. Later, Tom presents a solution to the ceiling height challenge in the old part of the kitchen: a structural ceiling that will allow him to gain some height over the islands, while allowing for both adequate structure, and a clever chase for wiring.</desc>

    <desc>Norm visits the Hancock-Clarke house to see where Paul Revere stopped to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams of the advancing British troops during the start of the American Revolution. Kevin recaps how the roofers applied new architectural shingles to tie the old house in with the new addition. Tom shows Kevin the progress on the new back deck, and how the architect has called for a corner stair leading down to the backyard. The framing requires two sets of traditional stringer systems, joined in the middle by a hip stringer and a series of jack stringers  the same idea as framing a hip roof. Kevin finds Richard and plumbing contractor Kevin Bilo fighting to keep the P-trap from the new bathtub on the second floor from interfering with the decorative ceiling of the new kitchen. They use a new German bath waste and overflow kit that allows for the flexibility needed to solve the problem. Kevin and Norm finish up the trim and decking on the new corner deck stair. For the ipe deckboards that are sharply mitered in the corner, Norm has settled on using a floating tenon connection to prevent them from opening up over time</desc>

    <title>Lexington Colonial | Making Connections</title>
    <desc>Roger meets landscape designer Tim Lee to see how the small stream in the backyard affects all other areas of the yard, including a patch of grass that has to be returned to the wild, and a stand of trees out front that can now be removed after careful consideration by the Conservation Commission. Before the trees come down, Roger shows Kevin the valuable shade plants that could be damaged in the process, so they're relocated to a new bed in the side yard to provide screening from the neighboring house. Tom and Kevin cut away a five-foot section of wall to connect the new kitchen to the old great room. Richard shows Kevin two common rough plumbing conditions in the kitchen: a main sink that has a traditional drain and vent configuration, and an island prep sink, which requires a bow vent in order to work properly. Kevin meets building inspector Fred Lonardo to learn how a GC can call for a "partial framing inspection" to keep progress moving on a job, as in the case with our front porch. Arborist John Marquis shows Roger the proper preparation, safety precautions, and procedures for doing a "take down" of the 12 trees in the front yard.</desc>

Inside, two weeks of rough electrical is coming to a close as the subs call for their inspection. Kevin meets electrician Allen Gallant and inspector Alix Berube to see what goes into a rough electrical inspection. At the back deck, Tom shows Kevin how he's using a hybrid railing system that has cedar posts and railing caps, with stainless steel cable "balusters". Kevin visits kitchen designer Donna Venegas at her showroom at Boston's Design Center to see the neutrals, textures, and metallics that are currently trending in kitchens. Then, project designer Michele Kelly and homeowner Jeremy Kieval show Kevin the layout and design choices for the new family kitchen. With a house from 1966, almost anything goes, so paint color expert Bonnie Krims gives Kevin and homeowner Jody Kieval a range of options for the exterior colors</desc>

    <title>The Veteran's Special House Project | The Veteran's Special House Project</title>
    <desc>Over three special episodes, This Old House is partnering with Homes For Our Troops (HFOT) to build a houseäó_í‹í¬from the ground upäó_í‹í¬for one Army veteran and his family, as a way to highlight the heroes who have given so much for their country. In 2003, while on his first deployment to Iraq, SSG Matt Dewitt and his battalion came under attack, leaving Matt with devastating injuries that resulted in the amputation of both arms. We meet Matt and his family at his current home to understand the challenges of day-to-day and why a HFOT specially adapted home will be life changing. Kevin meets Buildings Project Manager Mike Duckett in Hopkinton, NH to see the plans for the DeWitt project. Norm, Tom and Kevin join builder Ken Dionne and his team to help with framing the exterior walls. Kevin meets the HFOT Chairman, Four Star General Richard Cody, to understand their mission. Kevin then travels to Florida to meet Justin Gaertner, another veteran who also received a specially adapted home from HFOT. Kevin rejoins the project in New Hampshire and finds that all the exterior walls are secured and the truss roof is going up.</desc>

    <title>I'M LIVE: S1 E216</title>
    <desc>Joining us on this week's I'm LIVE is singer Sam Kim! This artist made himself known to the public in 2013 as the runner-up of the popular talent show "K-pop Star Season 3." Then he made his official debut in 2016 and has been mesmerizing listeners with his velvety voice and songwriting skills since then. Thanks to his outstanding musicality, he has also worked with a number of A-list musicians, including IU, Crush, Zico, and more. In June this year, Sam Kim released his new single "The Juice" after a break of about 2 years. With a blend of retro pop and hip hop, this autobiographic song depicts his worn-out state of mind interestingly through groovy dance moves. So he has proved that he can sing, compose, and even dance, making us eagerly anticipate what more he has in store for us. In this episode, Sam Kim performs "The Juice," "Make Up," "Seattle" and more to showcase the quintessence of his artistry. Tune in to I'm LIVE and meet this talented singer!</desc>

    <title>Open Mike Knight - Episode 208</title>
    <desc>The Book of Betrayal leads Jestro and his Monsters to Funnyton - the funnies town in the kingdom.  When they Knights arrive to capture him, they discover (to their shock) that Jestro and the Book of Monsters are now the town's top comedians! Jestro and his monsters are in attack formation moving to pillage the town of Funnyton.  But when they arrive, ready to tear into the place, they see that nobody's in town.  Then, they hear...laughter?!  The entire town is there listening to a stand-up comic JOKES  KNIGHTLY.  He's hilarious.  He commands such power, such attention, and such loyalty.  Jestro and the BOM decide they must become funny.  They order all kinds of book on comedy from Spamazon: books on parody, irony, insult humor, slapstick, satire, knock-knock jokes, elephant jokes, "my monster is so fat" jokes, etc.  They work-up a ventriloquist act with the BOM sitting on Jestro's lap.  They start doing their act and, surprisingly, they're funny.  They're very funny.   The Fortrex arrives and the knights rush out, ready for battle.  They fight through a string of monsters just outside the town, but discover they're only working as "bouncers" to keep too many people out of the comedy club.  ("Sorry, you guys aren't on the list.") The knights hear loud laughs and head there.  In the club, they discover the town isn't being held hostage, they're in the show voluntarily having a great time.  And...Jestro and the BOM are funny.  Meanwhile, during the show, Jokes Knightly decides he'll steal the BOM and Jestro's act.  During the intermission at the comedy show, Clay comes backstage to talk to Jestro.  Maybe, Clay says, this shows that Jestro doesn't have to be bad...he is funny, like Clay always said he was. Meanwhile, Jokes Knightly steals the BOM and Jestro can't find it.  He panics.  Clay encourages him...go on stage alone, be funny...he can do it!  Jestro goes out and is funny on his own  he hits all his punchlines, he gets big laughs  he starts to see that Clay is right.  The BOM sees that Jokes Knightly has a "joke book" that turns out to be the BOOK OF BETRAYAL.  That's how Mike Knight has become so funny - by stealing everyone's material!  BOM calls in Magmar, who saves him from Mike Knight AND takes the Book of Betrayal.  As Jestro comes off-stage to great applause, the BOM tells him they have the Book of Betrayal.  The BOM calls in Magmar and his monsters and they start a fight as Clay comes to Jestro's defense and calls on the other Knights for backup.  A big battle ensues that destroys the comedy club in Funnyton.  The Knights win and drive-off Magmar, the monsters and the BOM.  As they retreat, the BOM looks around: "Where's my Jestro?!"  Jestro sneaked away during the fight and is in a nearby forest with...the Book of Betrayal.</desc>

    <title>The Stone Army</title>
    <desc>The ninja face off with an exhibit of a Stone Samurai Warrior that the toxic venom from the Great Devourer has brought to life while Garmadon manages to find a fabled Dark Island that is said to hold dark powers. Lord Garmadon struggles controlling the Serpentine now that he is without the Mega-Weapon. His latest endeavor is to lead the snakes in search of a fabled Dark Island that ancient texts say holds dark powers. Unable to find the island, the furious Serpentine abandon Lord Garmadon out at sea. Meanwhile, Lloyd and the Ninja are called to the museum to find the toxic venom from the Great Devourer has seeped into the ground beneath the city, and it's brought an exhibit of a Stone Samurai Warrior to life! Our heroes come across Misako, Lloyd's long lost mother. She's an archeologist in search of stopping the prophesized battle between Lloyd and his father. She had unearthed the Stone Warrior, and shares how it was once part of an indestructible army created by a dark spirit named The Overlord.  When the balance is altered and evil is let into Ninjago, it will allow the Overlord to return and bring darkness and destruction to the land. Unable to destroy the Terminator-like Stone Warrior, the Ninja cleverly trap it. In the end, Lord Garmadon awakens on a small island at sea and hears the voice of the banished Overlord, promising him his wildest dreams. Garmadon uses his four hands to activate a mechanism, raising a lost land from out of the sea, creating a Yin/Yang symbol with Ninjago. The ultimate battle between good and evil begins to unfold.</desc>

    <title>The Fortrex And The Furious - Episode 209</title>
    <desc>In a massive chase around Knighton, the NEXO-Knights attempt to keep the Book of Betrayal out of the Book of Monster's grip.  But the evil book is persistent.  Will he get the final piece of his evil puzzle? We finally REVEAL that Jestro has given the Book of Betrayal to...Clay.  He tells Clay what it is and how Mike Knight used it.  And it seems that the Book of Monsters believed it to be the final ingredient in some 'Master Plan."  Suddenly, they realize Monsters - led by Magmar and the super-mad Book of Monster - are after them!  Clay retreats with Jestro and the Book of Betrayal to rendezvous with the other Knights at the Fortrex.  The Fortrex isn't fast enough  they'll need their own vehicles. They decide that they need to split up and go in multiple directions to make the monsters expend their resources on a chase.  It's a huge chase, being covered like a crazy news event by the Knighton News Network.  We see a montage of the monsters stopping and capturing all the Knights vehicles: Aaron, Macy, Lance...finally Axl.  However, as they do, they realize that the Knights have used Squirebots in Jestro Fan Jester hats (from the vendor at the comedy club in 108) as decoys.  They think Axl has the Book of Betrayal in his BRICK containment unit, but it turns out to be the Ned Knightly Comic from episode 203.  The Monsters finally corner Clay, who has the real Jestro and Book of Betrayal in his sword vehicle.  Before Clay can protest, Jestro pushes the launch button and fires off Clay in the vehicle's rocket sword.  The monsters race off with Jestro, leaving the shocked Clay fearing for his friend. Now, Magmar tells the Book of Monsters, they only need to get BOB.  Clay makes his way back to the Fortrex and tells what has happened. They decide they must get to the Redoubt of Ruination in the Lava Lands and try to save Jestro.  Meanwhile, we see, INTERCUT, a scene where Merlok 2.0 and the Book of Monsters explain the Books of Evil, how they were created and what the BOM will use them for.  Merlok, back in the day, split the evil MONSTRUX into 10 magic books to keep him from ever being a threat.  Only, he didn't destroy the books...and now the BOM has them and Monstrux can come back into the world!  Meanwhile, the BOM has set up the huge, ceremonial arena at their HQ so they can have the ceremony to bring Monstrux back into the world.  Jestro realizes he's been a pawn of the Book of Monsters.  Jestro says he'll never get the Book of Betrayal...the Knights have it.

    <title>The Day Ninjago Stood Still</title>
    <desc>The ninja try to flee from the rest of the Stone Army that has been brought to life by the Devourer's toxic venom - and things get a lot worse when Garmadon arrives with a 'Helmet of Darkness' and seizes control of the Stone Army. Scales finally takes leadership over the Serpentine and plans to burrow beneath Ninjago City to level it to the ground. But as they burrow, they run into a lost chamber holding the rest of the Stone Army. The Devourer's toxic venom in the ground brings the Stone Army to life, sealing the Serpentine in their tomb, and returning the snakes back to where they were first found. On the Dark Island, the Overlord directs Lord Garmadon to a giant celestial clock. Garmadon removes a 'Helmet of Darkness', which will grant the wearer control over the Stone Army, and also activate the clock to tick down to when the final battle will begin. Back in Ninjago City, the indestructible Stone Army surfaces and attacks, and the Ninja know the only thing they can do is to save as many people as they can. They manage to barely escape with other townspeople, only for the Destiny's Bounty's engines to get damaged. In the end, Lord Garmadon arrives with the helmet, and seizes control of the Stone Army.</desc>

    <title>Kingdom Of Heroes - Episode 210</title>
    <desc>The Book of Monsters, having the final pieces of his evil plan in place, tries to take human form.  Can the NEXO-Knights and Merlok 2.0 stop the greatest threat they've ever faced?  Or will the kingdom be plunged into darkness...forever. The Redoubt of Ruination readies the final ceremony to call forth MONSTRUX, the arch-necromancer of the past.  Clay, holding the Book of Betrayal walks to the gates of the spooky place.  Inside, Clay hears strange...singing and music.  It's like a twisted Broadway show of some kind.  Meanwhile, the Knights all realize Clay is gone and so is the Book of Betrayal.  Macy says Clay must be up to something.  They have to trust him and, more importantly, they have to find him.  At the Redoubt of Ruination the ceremony has already begun!  The Book of Monsters wants the final ceremony that calls forth Monstrux to be like a really great show!  The BOM then barfs up all the BOOKS OF EVIL into their places around Jestro.  He's just missing the BOOK OF BETRAYAL, which Clay has.  Clay says he'll trade the book for Jestro.  The BOM immediately agrees to the deal and sets Jestro free.  Then, Monsters grab-up Clay, restrain him, and put him in Jestro's place on the sacrifice stone.  From outside, they're interrupted by the sounds of battle  the Knights have arrived on the Fortrex and are attacking the Redoubt of Ruination.  In the confusion, Jestro slips away.  The BOM lets loose with a powerful protection spell to keep the Knights out as he starts with the ceremony...he's going to bring Monstrux out and remanifest him in Clay's body!  Jestro is able to escape the Redoubt and make his way to the Knights, who can't seem to battle their way in.  It's a race against time as the Knights try to get in and save Clay.  As the Knights get in, they see that the crazy BOM is absorbing all the Books of Evil, one-by-one.  He grows BIGGER and BIGGER!  Macy calls for NEXO-Power...but it's not enough!  The gigantic Book of Monsters sucks down the final book, the Book of Betrayal!  He looms over Clay, about to consume him, too, and make him into Monstrux!  Suddenly, Robin appears carrying TECHKALIBER...he tosses it to Clay.  Just as the huge Book of Monsters falls on Clay, he holds up Techkaliber and Merlok 2.0 is there...his full power in the sword.  Clay sticks the sword into the Book of Monster's huge mouth.  BOOM!  There's a BIG, MAGICAL EXPLOSION!  As we cut back inside, we see the Book of Monsters is gone.  The Knights release Clay and he thanks them and Jestro for saving him.  Jestro thanks them all for saving him and seeing the good in him.  WE DISSOLVE TO: The JoustDome.  In a final ceremony the King and Queen reward the knights and congratulate them for keeping the kingdom safe.  There are speeches, happiness and friendship.  And Jestro even does a bit that's funny.  At the very end we see a hint of something...Monstrux and the Book of Monsters are still out there.</desc>

    <desc>The Ninjas, Lloyd, Sensei Wu and Misako journey to the Dark Island to find a 'Temple of Light' that can restore the Ninjas' elemental powers but are attacked by Starteeth (barnacle-like star fish) that start eating through their ship. The Stone Army and Lord Garmadon have disappeared, and our heroes can see the mysterious Dark Island off their coastline. Fearing Garmadon is up to no good, Sensei Wu has the whole team suit up to begin a journey to the Dark Island. Since the Bounty's engines are damaged, they plan to go by sea. Misako reveals her ancient scrolls state of a 'Temple of Light' that could return the Ninja's elemental powers, and it could be found on the island. Meanwhile, Lord Garmadon has the Army mining for more 'Dark Matter', using it to build a Super-Weapon that will recreate Ninjago in a twisted evil way. When a storm hits at sea, our heroes are attacked by Starteeth (barnacle-like starfish that can eat through a ship) and are forced to find refuge on a lighthouse at sea. Inside, Zane discovers his inventor father, the Tinkerer, is alive!  Together, they repair the Bounty so it can fly again, escaping a giant Leviathan, and soaring to the Dark Island ahead.</desc>

    <title>The Cloud - Episode 301</title>
    <desc>A storm is brewing over Knighton. Monstrox has taken the form of a cloud, and is raising an army of lightning infused Stone Monsters. His first target is the new Lavalands Amusement Park. Harmony reigns in Knighton as the Knights pursue their civilian lives: Lance has a TV talk show  Axl is the singing chef on the show  Jestro is the weatherman  Clay is teaching at the Knights' Academy  Macy, Ava and Merlok 2.0 travel the land in the Fortrex making sure the kingdom's defenses are ready (part of a plan she and Clay have)  Aaron and his hover shield is travelling the land setting extreme records. Robin is at his workshop at the Knights' Academy doing an "independent study" - he's working on some top secret project for Merlok 2.0. It all seems excellent! We even see the Knights new vehicles - which have been optimized for civilian life (except for Clay's.) But storm clouds are brewing. Well, one storm cloud is brewing: the Cloud of Monstrox! Yes, the Book of Monsters has reconstituted himself and is now a cloud who needs a man on the ground to enact his new evil plan. He follows his old buddy Jestro as he goes across the realm on the weekends apologizing for being evil. ZAP! With one bolt of his evil magic lighting, the Cloud of Monstrox turns Jestro evil again (only this time a bit, well, too evil.) The evil duo are back together - and bring stone to life for the first time in the form of Gargoyles from the town of GHOULIA. Now they must gather the Forbidden Powers so that the Cloud of Monstrox can destroy the entire kingdom! A battle breaks out in the Lava Lands, where Lance and Alice Squires are reporting from the opening of the Cuthbert Richmond funded Lava Lands Amusement Park, rebuilt from the remains of Jestro's old HQ. Jestro and the Cloud are after something in the remains and as Merlok 2.0 sends out a call for the Knights to help Lance. Can Lance (with an assist from King Halbert in his Mech) hold-off Jestro, the Cloud and their new army of stone fighters?!</desc>

    <title>The Island Of Darkness</title>
    <desc>After battling off Garmadon's Stone Army, the Ninjas finally arrive at the Temple of Light where they harness their pure elemental powers, concentrating them onto Lloyd who becomes more powerful than he ever imagined. The Ninja camouflage the Bounty, creating a secret rebel base on the island. Misako says they must find the Temple of Light, because only when their elemental powers return, will they be strong enough to defeat the indestructible Stone Army. The Ninja search the dark, exotic island and come across Garmadon's compound, where they're building the Super-Weapon. The Ninja discover the Temple of Light is hidden at the highest peak of the island, and the Tinkerer aids their trek in creating a Drill Dozer so they can travel underground unnoticed. A final chase and battle takes place at the Temple of Light, as the Ninja solve the puzzle and harness their pure elemental powers, concentrating them onto Lloyd, who also becomes more powerful then he ever imagined. Their new abilities can destroy the indestructible Stone Warriors. Although Lord Garmadon finds this to be a setback, the Overlord reassures him darkness will prevail, as we end on seeing the Celestial Clock ticking down closer to zero.</desc>

    <title>A Little Rusty - Episode 302</title>
    <desc>The Cloud of Monstrox and Jestro unlocks a mysterious Forbidden Power. What kind ofhavoc will they unleash? And can Merlok 2.0 and the NEXO KNIGHTS make the new COMBO NEXO Powers  work? The Knights finally make it to the Lava Lands - using their various new forms of transport, which are all strictly civilian vechicles - and they must regroup and learn to fight together again to face the new threat of Jestro, the Cloud of Monstrox, and their STONE MONSTERS (in this case, Stone Gargoyles.) But Jestro and his monsters beat back the knights and recover the STAFF OF MONSTROX - which was buried under the ceremonial chamber from Episode 210 (and is now the Lava Puker amusement park ride) - and they get away on Jestro's EVIL MOBILE, which he recovers from the HQ garage. Macy says this is exactly why she's been touring the kingdom preparing everyone for the next attack. The Knights have to get it together because now the entire kingdom is under threat...again. Robin decides he must upgrade the Knights' vehicles and make them more "fight optimized." Ava and Merlok 2.0 must figure out how to use new NEXO Powers because regular NEXO Powers do make Stone monsters back into stone, but the Cloud simply zaps them to life again. Meanwhile, in the IRON MOUNTAINS, Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox find the first of the Forbidden Powers: RELENTLESS RUST. They find the ROGUL STATUE holding the power and zap him to life. Now...they can rust those shiny knights to pieces! Ava and Merlok are attempting to use NEXO COMBO POWERS - with hilarious results - as they try to figure out how they might work. When Jestro attacks, he's able to halt the Fortrex by instantly rusting its tracks and wheels! Robin has his hands full trying to clean all the rust from the attack of Relentless Rust. As the Knights attempt to defend against Jestro, the Cloud is zapping statues to life. He hits a statue with a bolt of lightning as Clay is touching it. Something happens...Clay feels odd  stiff  as if rock is mixing with his body. Finally, Ava and Merlok 2.0 download to the Knights their new thing: a COMBO NEXO COMBO Power. It works! It can smash the animated statues to dust! They use it to defeat Jestro, but he and the Cloud get away with the Forbidden Power of Relentless Rust. Victory ... sort of. Clay talks to Merlok 2.0...something has happened to him. What can they do? Merlok 2.0 is very concerned.</desc>

    <title>The Last Hope</title>
    <desc>When the Ninjas' attempt to return Garmadon's 'Helmet of Darkness' to its perch at the Celestial Clock in order to prevent the final battle between Lloyd and his father from beginning fails, a Super Weapon is created that can destroy all of Ninjago. With the Overlord and Garmadon nearing completion of the Super-Weapon, Misako tells the group she thinks there could be one last chance at preventing Lloyd's final battle with his father. She believes if they can steal the helmet off Garmadon's head and return it to it's rightful perch on the Celestial Clock, it could stop the clock before it reaches zero, thus preventing the final battle from beginning. Dressed as Warriors, the Ninja escort their 'captive' Misako to Garmadon, and the heroes see glimpses of the Super-Weapon being built. In a thrilling escape, Misako cleverly steals Garmadon's helmet, and they race to the Celestial Clock. Lloyd has a brief encounter with his father, and hesitates striking him. When they return the helmet to its rightful perch, they're one second too late, allowing the clock to reach zero, and for it to focus a beam of concentrated light from the sky into the Super-Weapon. Nya is taken hostage, as the others fall off a cliff, barely surviving the fall. The Ninja have failed -- the final battle has begun.</desc>

    <title>Thunderstox - Episode 303</title>
    <desc>Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox encounters the sculptor. He helps unleash a horde of fierce garden gnomes on Knighton. What will the NEXO KNIGHTS do against this new enemy? Will their new COMBO NEXO Powers do the trick? As Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox head off on the Evil Mobile to 'store' the Forbidden Power in a secret location, they encounter...THE SCULPTOR. His real name is ROBERTO ARNOLDI. He's a sensitive and odd artist who has been laid off by the king (the King ordered a "smashing" statue of the Queen, and the Sculptor made a statue of the Queen literally smashing monsters. He takes everything very literally.) Jestro instructs him to make a "bad" statue that he can use to attack the knights. The Sculptor sets to work. Meanwhile, the NEXO KNIGHTS are discussing the COMBO NEXO Powers, the Forbidden Powers, and what all this means. Lance, meanwhile, decides that since his talk show career is on hold, he thinks he'll install cameras in the Fortrex and do a Big Brother-like expose show on the Knights (he decides NOT to tell the others.) Merlok 2.0 and the Cloud of Monstrox (each talking to their cohorts) explain the history of the Forbidden Powers: it's a history lesson about the WIZARDS' COUNCIL, the Forbidden Powers, and how they were stopped long ago. This visual montage leads Jestro to...MOUNT THUNDERSTROX. The Cloud of Monstrox shows him the circle of ten Standing Stones where he will insert the Forbidden Powers. "What'll happen after that?" asks Jestro, curious. "Oh, I don't want to spoil the surprise," says the Cloud. They insert the first Forbidden Power, Relentless Rust, and it locks into place on its stone. They go off to battle the Knights and collect the "bad" statue the sculptor is making. But he's made a literally bad statue...it's terrible ... garden gnomes. Like an amateur art student. And...it's not even finished. ("You can't rush bad genius!") The Knights attack with their newly modified vehicles and they succeed in destroying the Evil Mobile. They then try to use a COMBO NEXO Power, but can't...it had to be perfect to work (Ava and Merlok need to work on it.) As Jestro and the Cloud retreat, Merlok again talks to Clay about turning to stone! Merlok calls in Robin...he will need him to build something to help Clay as he becomes more and more impaired.</desc>

    <title>Return Of The Overlord</title>
    <desc>When Garmadon uses his new Super-Weapon to turn Jamakai Village evil, he unwittingly unsettles the balance, allowing the spirit of the Overlord to cross over and possesses his body. Lord Garmadon witnesses the Super-Weapon come to life, revealing it to be 'Garma-Tron', a giant moving cannon. His first test subject is Nya. Meanwhile, the heroes prepare for the final battle and sneak-attack Garmadon's compound...only to find it empty. The Super-Weapon is moving towards the coastline, where the cannon's range can reach Ninjago. On the way there, the Ninja must face off with Evil Nya, turned dark from the Super-Weapon. On the coastline, Lloyd battles his father atop Garma-Tron. The battle is fierce, but Lloyd fails at stopping his father from firing Garma-Tron, turning Jamanakai Village evil. Garmadon naively celebrates, not realizing he's undone the balance, allowing the spirit of the Overlord to cross over and possess his body. And as the Overlord continues to get more powerful, a hideous metamorphosis is taking place. Lloyd must fight the Overlord, and just when it looks like good will prevail, Lloyd is injured and thrown to the ground. In the end, the villains escape through a portal to Ninjago, and our heroes are abandoned on the island with no way home. And with the Green Ninja injured, it looks like all is lost. Evil has won.</desc>

    <title>Rotten Luck - Episode 304</title>
    <desc>Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox unleashes the Forbidden Power Ravaging Rot on Knighton! Turning everything into green gooey rot. But Robin has an awesome new invention that could help the NEXO KNIGHTS Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox find a second Forbidden Power near the falling down Swamp Castle: RAVAGING ROT. With this power, they can make everything in the kingdom rot - food, vegetation, anything that grows or is natural. And that's exactly what they do! It's awful and makes everything stink. The Sculptor start to sculpt a portable HeadQuarter for his master, Jestro. Jestro expects it to be done when they return from ravaging the land. Axl is very concerned - he's into organic food ... and now food starts to rot. Merlok 2.0 and Ava are continuing to work on perfecting the COMBO NEXO Powers. We see display screens of MANY of the NEXO Powers. But there's a huge power consumption issue with these new-fangled combos. "I'll have to find an algorithmic power curve consumption solution, magic man," says Ava. "I always just sort of choose them by, uh, feel." "What do you feel like?" "Uh, a ham sandwich, a banana, and dragon fire," responds Merlok. "That produced a combo with 2% efficiency," says Ava. "This is why we have to actually THINK about and study perfec Combos. We need automatic power integration." The Knights must stop Jestro from rotting all the food and living plant matter in Knighton and Axl leads the charge. But as they finally confront Jestro, who's trying to rot a field of beans near Fruitbridge, they're hit by his finally completed ROLLING HQ (the Sculptor is proud of the "artsy" elements.) ... it's not exactly perfect though ... he took the idea of Head Quarter a little too litteral and created a big head. Finally, in this conclusive battle where the knights get strapped on a rotting bridge, Clay emerges in a sleek, new BATTLE SUIT that Robin built for him because he was starting to have trouble moving around (the whole turning to stone thing.) It's smaller and more high-tech than the bigger Mechs of the past. Clay's able to drive Jestro off. Jestro, at the end of the episode, puts the Forbidden Power of Ravaging Rot into Mount Thunderstrox. Meanwhile, back at the Fortrex, Axl makes an organic food feast for all his fellow Knights.</desc>

    <title>The Book Of Monsters, Part 2 - Episode 102</title>
    <desc>Realizing they must defend the Kingdom from Jestro's monsters, the Knights try to organize but are despondent when they discover their best advisor - Merlok the Magician - has sacrificed himself to save them.   When Jestro awakens, he's been blasted miles and miles away from the King's Castle by Merlok's explosive spell.  And, it seems, all the books he was trying to steal have been scattered, too.  The Book of Monsters broke Jestro' fall and now he can use the book to attack the people who laughed at him.  Meanwhile, the King and his newly-trained Knights pick through the rubble of Merlok's library.  They'll have to figure something out, because Jestro and his newly made magic monsters attack King's Castle!  Clay organizes the Knights to defend the kingdom, but they've never worked together before.  It takes all their training, plus the help of an old friend...MERLOK!  Only now he's MERLOK 2.0.  Ava has been piecing together what happened and discovering that the "ghost in the machine" she's been chasing is really Merlok in digital form.  Now, he can use his magic digitally and he downloads just the right weapons to the struggling Knights!  They finally foil Jestro's attack with Merlok's help and officially become NEXO KNIGHTS!</desc>
