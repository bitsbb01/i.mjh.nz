    <title>Don Friesen - Live In Provo</title>
    <desc>Husband. Idiot. Dad. His kids think he's fun. His wife thinks he's an idiot. Audiences think he's hilarious! Don is a modern suburban dad just trying to raise his kids and get through the day with a bit of money in the bank and a scrap of dignity intact. With a unique style that can best be described as frenetic and engaging, Don captures the irony of parenting, marriage and everyday absurdities through characters, voices, parodies and some of the best written routines around. He's a wanna-be geek who constantly upgrades to the latest technology, but can never get it to work, leading to signature bits about tech support, Idiots Guides, texting and passwords. Friesen has recently taken his smart, savvy, and highly-caffeinated comedy to the stage at the Alex Theatre in Glendale, CA, for the taping of his new Showtime one-hour special titled "Ask Your Mom." In his first nationally released concert special, Don delivers a winning hour of clever, true-to-life "he's talking about my family up there" comedy that manages to be adult-smart yet family-friendly.</desc>

    <desc>Originally from the Midwest, raised in Orange County, college in Montana and a three-year stint in Asia make Patrick Keane a comedian with a background. Why college in Montana? Football scholarship. Why Asia? To get away from football.Since moving to Los Angeles in 2000, Patrick has appeared on Comedy Centrals Live At Gotham, the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, the Bob and Tom show, Comics Unleashed, the Montreal Comedy Festival and is a regular at the Improv and Comedy Store in Hollywood. He was also a cast member on My TV Networks Tony Rock Project. (He was the white guy).When not headlining, Patrick is the opening act for comedians such as Nick Swardson, Joel McHale, Kevin Nealon, Kevin Pollok, Bobby Lee, Henry Phillips, Eddie Gossling and Bil Dwyer. While at home in Los Angeles he studies at the UCB theatre and Lesley Kahn institute. Asked what the key is to comedy, this writer/actor/comedian says, I try not to be funny and it usually works. With multiple appearances on the Late Late show with Craig Ferguson, his record setting viewer ship on Comedy Central, and his ability to tell the difference between people from Ireland and people from Northern Ireland, Patrick is the obvious choice to be the next host of the Oprah Winfrey show.His dry, self-deprecating style originates from influences Bill Murray and Gene Wilder. His favorite stand up comedians are Chris Rock, Lewis Black, Gary Shandling, Jerry Seinfeld and many other female comics not from New York.</desc>

    <title>Dry Bar Comedy:Patrick Keane - long love the keane</title>
    <desc>Originally from the Midwest, raised in Orange County, college in Montana and a three-year stint in Asia make Patrick Keane a comedian with a background. Why college in Montana? Football scholarship. Why Asia? To get away from football.Since moving to Los Angeles in 2000, Patrick has appeared on Comedy Centrals Live At Gotham, the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, the Bob and Tom show, Comics Unleashed, the Montreal Comedy Festival and is a regular at the Improv and Comedy Store in Hollywood. He was also a cast member on My TV Networks Tony Rock Project. (He was the white guy).When not headlining, Patrick is the opening act for comedians such as Nick Swardson, Joel McHale, Kevin Nealon, Kevin Pollok, Bobby Lee, Henry Phillips, Eddie Gossling and Bil Dwyer. While at home in Los Angeles he studies at the UCB theatre and Lesley Kahn institute. Asked what the key is to comedy, this writer/actor/comedian says, I try not to be funny and it usually works. With multiple appearances on the Late Late show with Craig Ferguson, his record setting viewer ship on Comedy Central, and his ability to tell the difference between people from Ireland and people from Northern Ireland, Patrick is the obvious choice to be the next host of the Oprah Winfrey show.His dry, self-deprecating style originates from influences Bill Murray and Gene Wilder.

After winning both the Seattle and San Francisco Comedy Competitions, then performing for a US President the same year, his career took off and has never stopped.  On stage Crowe is armed with a "gallery of facial expressions", a host of accents and a "nerdy charisma that is utterly captivating." He has been featured on Showtime with his own One Hour Comedy Special "Crooked Finger," along with numerous appearances on Comedy Central, Bob&amp;Tom Radio, SiriusXM and Pandora.  Overseas, he crushed the competition at the Edinburgh International Fringe Festival garnering three perfect 5-Star reviews from their rather sticky and jaded press (you can read them here in the Testimonials section). David is a guaranteed hit on the corporate entertainment circuit.  He has performed at literally hundreds of corporate and private events across the United States and Canada.  (See "Past Client" list under Testimonials).  He recently concluded a nationwide comedy tour for Investors Group, a financial services company, where he performed for over 60,000 of their most valued clients in 60 different cities.   To date, David has released five comedy albums.   He believes the best way to stay sharp and relevant is to continue to hone and perfect new material at comedy clubs across the country with the goal of releasing an new comedy special every few years.</desc>

    <desc>For someone like Capt. Cory who's out on the water most days of the year, it's easy to notice the little changes that show the stress on an ecosystem. Whether that's subtle movements of fish from lingering red tide blooms or large-scale impacts from high-volume Lak Okeechobee discharges, he sees it all, and he's ready for things to change. "I wish we would get to a point where we really put our foot down and do something about it before it's too late." Watch this episode to learn more about what's going on and to see why Capt. Cory is so passionate about fighting to protect the places he loves. Visit https://captainsforcleanwater.org to join the fight.</desc>

    <title>Lemon Cheesecake</title>
    <desc>Although some would never dare to adulterate plain cheesecake, variations abound-some good, some bad, some ugly. Lemon is the one version that serves a function by cutting through the cloying nature of this rich dessert. We discovered a host of different lemon cheesecake styles, but most of the lemon flavor was either too fleeting or too harsh. We wanted our cheesecake to be both light and creamy, with great lemon flavor.</desc>

    <title>Steak and Potatoes</title>
    <desc>Purchase a good steak and cook it properly, and all it needs is salt and pepper-and, of course, a side of spuds. Unfortunately, many of the inexpensive steaks labeled "great for grilling'' at the supermarket turn out tough and dry with little flavor. And mashed potatoes are often gluey or runny. We wanted potatoes with perfect texture and big flavor-something unusual to accompany a great steak and a good bottle of wine.</desc>

    <desc>Tuna, which is often served rare to medium-rare, can be particularly tricky to get just right, especially when you want a nicely seared crust. As for halibut, the texture of this fish usually fares better in a moist-heat cooking method such as braising, but this technique often means a loss of flavor. We develop the best recipes to highlight the best of both fish.</desc>

    <title>Hermanitas Calle</title>
    <desc>Las hermanitas Calle son dos mujeres humildes que dan todo por su familia, por su carrera artística y por un género musical que las baña de gloria y de fama, pero les arrebata gran parte de su infancia y toda su juventud. Nelly y Fabiola Calle se aferran a sus voces y se lanzan a posicionar la música popular, un género despreciado por emisoras y disqueras. Su vida no será fácil ya que serán obligadas a ser el sustento de su familia. De pequeñas sufrirán por cuenta de su papá y de adultas, por causa de sus maridos. Vivirán historias de abandono y desamor tan dramáticas como las letras de sus canciones. Su gran mérito es que arrancando desde abajo y con todo en contra, se aferran a su amor por la música y al poder desbordante de sus dos voces para lograr lo imposible: posicionar y venderle a la sociedad un género musical con el que pocos artistas alcanzan reconocimiento.</desc>

    <title>The Book Of Monsters, Part 1 - Episode 101</title>
    <desc>When Jestro the Jester finds the Book of Monsters, chaos breaks loose in the Kingdom of Knighton.  Can the newly graduated Knights from the Knights' Academy save the kingdom? It's final graduation fighting exams for the latest Knights from Knights' Academy.  All our new Knights demonstrate their prowess: CLAY, AARON, AXL and LANCE.  PRINCESS MACY get to join them, but her father doesn't want her to graduate.  As part of the entertainment, MERLOK does an amazing magic trick.  His act is followed by...JESTRO, the King's Jester.  He's terrible (and he should know to never follow a better act.) Everyone laughed because he's a real joke....a total failure. While Jestro roams the halls fo the King's Castle, forlorn, he hears the BOOK OF MONSTERS calling to him from Merlok's library. The book talks Jestro into gathering as many books of spells as he can carry, but they're interrupted by...Clay! As Jestro quickly pages through the Book of Monsters to attack Clay, Merlok arrives. There's a battle in the library between Jestro and Merlok. Finally, the wizard summons up his most powerful spell in self-defence. BOOM! There's a big, magical explosion and when Clay forces his way back into the library, Merlok, Jestro and the magic books are...GONE!</desc>

    <title>The Book Of Monsters, Part 2 - Episode 102</title>
    <desc>Realizing they must defend the Kingdom from Jestro's monsters, the Knights try to organize but are despondent when they discover their best advisor - Merlok the Magician - has sacrificed himself to save them.   When Jestro awakens, he's been blasted miles and miles away from the King's Castle by Merlok's explosive spell.  And, it seems, all the books he was trying to steal have been scattered, too.  The Book of Monsters broke Jestro' fall and now he can use the book to attack the people who laughed at him.  Meanwhile, the King and his newly-trained Knights pick through the rubble of Merlok's library.  They'll have to figure something out, because Jestro and his newly made magic monsters attack King's Castle!  Clay organizes the Knights to defend the kingdom, but they've never worked together before.  It takes all their training, plus the help of an old friend...MERLOK!  Only now he's MERLOK 2.0.  Ava has been piecing together what happened and discovering that the "ghost in the machine" she's been chasing is really Merlok in digital form.  Now, he can use his magic digitally and he downloads just the right weapons to the struggling Knights!  They finally foil Jestro's attack with Merlok's help and officially become NEXO KNIGHTS!</desc>

    <title>The Power Of Merlok - Episode 103</title>
    <desc>When Jestro attacks a village on the far side of the Kingdom, the NEXO-Knights wonder how they'll get there.  Then Macy remembers her dad has a royal RV...maybe they can "mod" that for their own, "knightly" use? Now the NEXO-Knights get rolling...in THE FORTREX, their own ROLLING CASTLE!  This great new HQ, which houses Merlok 2.0 as an operating system, will be how the knights move around Knighton and protect it from Jestro and his monsters.  Speaking of the evil jester, in this episode Jestro uses some newly-made monsters to attack a town far from the capitol where he thinks he's safe from the Knights' reach.  We see two parallel stories here: the Knights training, learning more about digital magic and getting organized as a team and at the same time we see Jestro making monsters, trying to learn how his powers work and talking to the Book.  In the end, the Knights roll up in their castle and defeat Jestro and his marauding monsters.  Lance thinks he should be the leader because he's a snot. "Of course I'm the leader...I'm a Richmond."</desc>

    <title>The Golden Castle - Episode 106</title>
    <desc>When Lance is cast as the star in the new remake of the classic movie "Ned Knightly and the Golden Castle" he doesn't anticipate Jestro and his monsters invading the set and ruining his starring role. It's movie time!  Lance does something very Lance: he agrees to star in a movie about remake of a classic film in Knighton: "The Golden Castle."  While pillaging a village, Jestro and the Book of Monsters see a movie poster for "The Golden Castle" and the book says the legendary Golden Castle is filled with riches!  Jestro explains that it's just a dumb movie and that it's not real.  It's all based on a "script."  The Book, who's been shelved for many years, wants to eat the movie script to learn more about the modern world.  On the set of the movie, Lance has invited the other Knights to act as extras.  When they see how Lance is being portrayed, they're incensed.  When Jestro attacks the movie set to get the script for his book to eat, the film director keeps rolling.  This battle footage is fantastic!  The Knights defeat Jestro even though the movie set is trashed.  The director will make it work.  At the premier of the movie, Lance is embarrassed to see that he's been reduced to comic relief for the realm's bravest Knight...Macy!  The director has now made her a star.</desc>

    <title>Whale Adventures With Nigel Marven</title>
    <desc>"Journey's End" - The whales are now on the home straight, and Nigel travels to the Bering Sea in the far west of Alaska to try to see them as they pass. On the Pribilof Islands he meets comical puffins, beautiful cormorants, cute Arctic foxes and fighting fur seals, but the whales prove elusive. But will his luck change when he tries further north, as the native Yupik people take him on a midnight boat ride through the icy seas round St Lawrence?

Back on the mainland, on the outskirts of the gold rush town of Nome, Nigel finds herds of shaggy muskoxen, before flying to Barrow, the most northerly city in the USA. Three hundred miles inside the Arctic Circle, polar bears roam the tundra and walrus float on icebergs offshore. The local Eskimos celebrate a successful hunting season with the spectacular blanket toss event - Nigel joins in but he's not very good at it! As the whales reach their final destination, Nigel takes a boat into the Chukchi Sea to say goodbye, and reminisces about the incredible journey they've shared.</desc>

    <title>Whale Adventures With Nigel Marven</title>
    <desc>"Journey's End" - The whales are now on the home straight, and Nigel travels to the Bering Sea in the far west of Alaska to try to see them as they pass. On the Pribilof Islands he meets comical puffins, beautiful cormorants, cute Arctic foxes and fighting fur seals, but the whales prove elusive. But will his luck change when he tries further north, as the native Yupik people take him on a midnight boat ride through the icy seas round St Lawrence?

Back on the mainland, on the outskirts of the gold rush town of Nome, Nigel finds herds of shaggy muskoxen, before flying to Barrow, the most northerly city in the USA. Three hundred miles inside the Arctic Circle, polar bears roam the tundra and walrus float on icebergs offshore. The local Eskimos celebrate a successful hunting season with the spectacular blanket toss event - Nigel joins in but he's not very good at it! As the whales reach their final destination, Nigel takes a boat into the Chukchi Sea to say goodbye, and reminisces about the incredible journey they've shared.</desc>
