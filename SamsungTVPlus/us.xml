    <desc>Eel is one of the most traditional ingredients in Japanese cooking. But in the U.S., the delicacy is still largely misunderstood. On this episode of Gochi Gang, Reina Scully is embarking on an eel-eating adventure. First, Chef Hiroki Fukushima gives Reina a crash course in the preparation of unagi, or freshwater eel, at Unagi Aburi Ittetsu. And later, Reina teams up with WWE superstar and sushi obsessive Asuka for an omakase experience centered around anago, unagi's saltwater cousin.</desc>

Her first stop is Niche, where chefs Frank Pinello, Mark Iacono, Carlo Carciotto, and Anthony Vitolo are ready to try mazemen, a saucy, brothless style of ramen. Chef Shigetoshi "Jack" Nakamura calls this dish "Japanese pasta"-but will his cheese and bacon-topped noodles satisfy some of NYC's most beloved Italian-American chefs?</desc>

    <title>TransMilitary</title>
    <desc>The 2018 SXSW Audience Award-winning feature film debut by Gabriel Silverman, Fiona Dawson, &amp; Jamie Coughlin, TransMilitary follows the Emmy-nominated short film Transgender, at War and in Love. Around 15,500 transgender people serve in the U.S. military (notably the largest transgender employer in the U.S.), where they must conceal their gender identity because military policies ban their service. TransMilitary chronicles the lives of four individuals (Senior Airman Logan Ireland, Corporal Laila Villanueva, Captain Jennifer Peace &amp; First Lieutenant El Cook) defending their country's freedom while fighting for their own. They put their careers and their families' livelihoods on the line by coming out as transgender to top brass officials in the Pentagon in hopes of attaining the equal right to serve. The ban was lifted in 2016, but with President Trump now trying to reinstate it, their futures hang in the balance once again.</desc>

    <title>Pasta Quick and Easy</title>
    <desc>Every cook needs quick pasta recipes in their repertoire. Pasta with garlic and oil is perhaps the most famous quick pasta dish. It starts with ingredients on hand-garlic, good olive oil, hot red pepper flakes-and turns them into something special and uncommonly good.</desc>

The test kitchen decided to tackle two popular sheet cakes-carrot and chocolate-and produce simple recipes that would deliver superior results.</desc>

With all songs composed, written, and arranged by the artist himself, he pleasantly surprised the ears and souls of listeners with his jazz-infused music and eventually brought a new wave to the Korean music scene. Throughout his 32-year career, Kim Hyun-chul gained much critical acclaim and commercial success, earning the nickname the "father of Korean city pop." Also, his debut album was chosen as one of the All-Time 100 Greatest Albums of Korean Popular Music, thanks to the influence it had had on the Korean music scene. Then in 2019, Kim Hyun-chul resumed his career after a break of 13 years and in celebration of the 30th anniversary of his debut. The album garnered much attention not only because of the anticipation of fans and critics but also because he brought an array of Korea’s leading artists along with him. His return coincided with the resurgence of city pop in Korea, and he's back once again 2 years later in 2021 to continue with the momentum. Part I of Kim Hyun-chul's performance on "I'm LIVE" features "What's the Matter?" "City Breeze &amp; Love Song," and "Tears of Joy." Tune in to the show and meet the legend!</desc>

    <title>RIFFTRAX - Uninvited</title>
    <desc>Uninvited is a horror movie written and directed by Star Games and Final Justice mastermind Greydon Clark, so it’s not surprising that Greydon Clark put himself in the movie. What is surprising? Pretty much everything else. This feature is a parody and contains the original movie combined with a comedic commentary by Mike, Kevin and Bill from RiffTrax (formerly of Mystery Science Theater 3000).</desc>

    <desc>When Jestro the Jester finds the Book of Monsters, chaos breaks loose in the Kingdom of Knighton.  Can the newly graduated Knights from the Knights' Academy save the kingdom? It's final graduation fighting exams for the latest Knights from Knights' Academy.  All our new Knights demonstrate their prowess: CLAY, AARON, AXL and LANCE.  PRINCESS MACY get to join them, but her father doesn't want her to graduate.  As part of the entertainment, MERLOK does an amazing magic trick.  His act is followed by...JESTRO, the King's Jester.  He's terrible (and he should know to never follow a better act.) Everyone laughed because he's a real joke....a total failure. While Jestro roams the halls fo the King's Castle, forlorn, he hears the BOOK OF MONSTERS calling to him from Merlok's library. The book talks Jestro into gathering as many books of spells as he can carry, but they're interrupted by...Clay! As Jestro quickly pages through the Book of Monsters to attack Clay, Merlok arrives. There's a battle in the library between Jestro and Merlok. Finally, the wizard summons up his most powerful spell in self-defence. BOOM! There's a big, magical explosion and when Clay forces his way back into the library, Merlok, Jestro and the magic books are...GONE!</desc>

    <desc>Realizing they must defend the Kingdom from Jestro's monsters, the Knights try to organize but are despondent when they discover their best advisor - Merlok the Magician - has sacrificed himself to save them.   When Jestro awakens, he's been blasted miles and miles away from the King's Castle by Merlok's explosive spell.  And, it seems, all the books he was trying to steal have been scattered, too.  The Book of Monsters broke Jestro' fall and now he can use the book to attack the people who laughed at him.  Meanwhile, the King and his newly-trained Knights pick through the rubble of Merlok's library.  They'll have to figure something out, because Jestro and his newly made magic monsters attack King's Castle!  Clay organizes the Knights to defend the kingdom, but they've never worked together before.  It takes all their training, plus the help of an old friend...MERLOK!  Only now he's MERLOK 2.0.  Ava has been piecing together what happened and discovering that the "ghost in the machine" she's been chasing is really Merlok in digital form.  Now, he can use his magic digitally and he downloads just the right weapons to the struggling Knights!  They finally foil Jestro's attack with Merlok's help and officially become NEXO KNIGHTS!</desc>

    <title>The Power Of Merlok - Episode 103</title>
    <desc>When Jestro attacks a village on the far side of the Kingdom, the NEXO-Knights wonder how they'll get there.  Then Macy remembers her dad has a royal RV...maybe they can "mod" that for their own, "knightly" use? Now the NEXO-Knights get rolling...in THE FORTREX, their own ROLLING CASTLE!  This great new HQ, which houses Merlok 2.0 as an operating system, will be how the knights move around Knighton and protect it from Jestro and his monsters.  Speaking of the evil jester, in this episode Jestro uses some newly-made monsters to attack a town far from the capitol where he thinks he's safe from the Knights' reach.  We see two parallel stories here: the Knights training, learning more about digital magic and getting organized as a team and at the same time we see Jestro making monsters, trying to learn how his powers work and talking to the Book.  In the end, the Knights roll up in their castle and defeat Jestro and his marauding monsters.  Lance thinks he should be the leader because he's a snot. "Of course I'm the leader...I'm a Richmond."</desc>

    <title>Wildlife Savers</title>
    <desc>Wildlife Savers is a documentary film about an extraordinary journey: 500 elephants will be moved to a new home in Malawi. This is one of the largest and most significant elephant translocations in human history. Due to poaching, habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, elephants are being decimated across Africa. 'Wildlife Savers' however, is a different story - one of hope and restoration and of securing the future for Malawi's elephants.

Although Malawi has a relatively peaceful history, the country sees increasing conflict between wildlife and people. Heavily armed poachers are prevalent, harvesting illegal ivory from the remaining elephants, which have been reduced by half from 4,000 to around 2,000 in only twenty years. The "Wildlife Savers" of African Parks resist the onslaught, committing their lives to stemming the violence. What enables them to persevere in their determination to bring about change? Will this, one of the largest elephant relocations in human history, be the solution for elephants and humans in the region?</desc>

    <title>Whale Adventures With Nigel Marven</title>
    <desc>"North to the Golden Gate" - The whales' journey takes them right up the coast of California, where the hustle and bustle of human activity is a stark contrast to the peace of the Mexican desert. Nigel takes a boat into the Santa Barbara channel to catch up with the greys as they swim past, and meets some even bigger whales, humpbacks, putting on an awe-inspiring acrobatic display. A little further out are the Channel Islands, protected havens for a huge variety of animals, both above and below the waves. Nigel plunges underwater to swim in the forests of kelp, and on the island of Santa Cruz he's led on a merry dance by a unique and diminutive fox.

Continuing north, the whales and the presenter pass Big Sur, an incredible landscape home to an incredible creature - the Californian condor. Like the grey whales, this rare bird came back from the brink of extinction thanks to conservation efforts. Travelling across the Golden Gate Bridge to the far north of the State, Nigel finishes his Californian adventure in Redwood National Park, among giant trees that have been alive since the time of Ancient Rome.</desc>
