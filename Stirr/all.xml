    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <desc>Two contestants, each teamed with a celebrity partner, compete in a word-association game. One player tries to guess a word based on clues offered by his or her partner. The game is timed, and if the clue-giver inadvertently says part of the word, a buzzer sounds and that round is lost. When the time is up, the team with the most points wins, and the non-celebrity contestants wins cash.</desc>

Inevitably, the mummy, which was really a monster, came alive and proceeded to terrorize the area.</desc>

    <desc>Host, Charlie David is on a quest to discover exactly what IS under those kilts in
our Glasgow episode. His tour stops include: a chat with the producer of
Glasgay (Glasgows annual celebration of queer culture), lacing up his skates
with the Glaswegian Roller derby girls, trying out for the HotScots gay football
team, and dropping down a wee pint or two with the lads and lasses in Merchant
City, Glasgows gay quarter. He also manages to try out a few kilt options for
himself.</desc>

Plus both Jay and Josh get into how they've tried to approach football with their kids, and when is the right time to get them into pads and tackle. And it wouldn't be complete without Jay and Josh joking about their ping pong battles in Chicago, and how they approached their games as they got later in their careers.
