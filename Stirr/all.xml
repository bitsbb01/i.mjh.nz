Dan also talks about his savage nature on the ice and how he earned the nickname "Car Bomb", why he loved to fight, and how painkillers in his day were handed out to players like candy. We also talk about Dan's suicidal thoughts when he was heavily medicated, before he discovered mushrooms and what they could do for him, and is very candid about how far into depression he really spiraled. Plus his company's work with psychedelics and how they work in relation to brain injuries, and the road to approval for use on a larger scale.</desc>

    <title>The Adam Carolla Show</title>
    <desc>Shane Gillis is in studio for a one-on-one conversation with Adam. They begin by talking about how woke culture is destroying comedy, and then flash back to Shanes upbringing and how he eventually got to audition for Saturday Night Live. From there they talk about the excitement of joining the cast, followed by the surprise of getting cancelled four days later. They also discuss the shift in people who are censoring others, keeping in touch with Lorne Michaels, and supporting the people who were unnecessarily cancelled. As the conversation wraps up, they talk about the importance of being able to say what you want as a comedian, and Shanes love of performing standup.

Stephan, Jason, Bracken and Nemis have never met, but theyre united by a shared passion for drag. They are about to come together for the first time  to perform Lady Gagas Born This Way at the world-famous Montreal Pride Festival. As they prepare for the big show, each faces their own unique challenges, as well as challenges they have in common - deep feelings of isolation and the struggle of trying to claim a place of your own on the fringes of a fringe culture.

    <title>Coming of Age in Cherry Grove</title>
    <desc>Founded in 1869, Cherry Grove (Fire Island, NY) is considered by most to be the first openly LGBTQ community in the United States. It has become known as one of the most accepting resort communities in the world  a place where you can not only discover who you are, but also freely experiment with who or what (gender) you may want to become. Cherry Grove is also known for the famous INVASION  an annual ritual that takes place every July 4th as a celebration of gender acceptance. This film tells the stories of a variety of long-term residents and what they find so wonderful about life in Cherry Grove.</desc>

    <title>Kumu Hina</title>
    <desc>Imagine a world where a little boy can grow up to be the woman of his dreams, and a young girl can rise to become a leader among men. Welcome to Kumu Hina's Hawai'i. Kumu Hina tells the inspiring story of Hina Wong-Kalu, a transgender native Hawaiian teacher, or kumu, who brings to life Hawaii's traditional embrace of mahu - those who embody both male and female spirit. Produced by Emmy-winning directors Dean Hamer and Joe Wilson in association with ITVS and Pacifc Islanders in Communications, the film traces Hina's evolution from Collin Wong, a timid high school boy, to her present position as a married woman and cultural director of a school in one of Honolulu's grittier neighborhoods. When Hoonani, a charismatic 6th grade girl, asks to join the school's all-male hula troupe, Kumu Hina gives her the opportunity to express her inner male spirit. As teacher and student prepare for a climactic end-of-year public performance, they meet many obstacles, but hold fast to the idea that being true to oneself matters most.</desc>

    <title>The Dead Mothers Club</title>
    <desc>The (Dead Mothers) Club tells the story of three women- a Southern artist redefining herself through her art; a high school senior struggling to gain independence; and a Brazilian living in NY, navigating first-time motherhood  all of whom lost their mothers during adolescence. The film reveals how coming of age without their mothers has and continues to play a role in their lives. Structured around a series of dialogues featuring Rosie ODonnell, Molly Shannon and Jane Fonda that focus on various themes threading their stories together, these ruminations allow for heart-breaking and at times humorous insight into how ultimately ones past can dictate their future. From the cyclical nature of grief to their own mortality, the women of The Club provoke thoughts surrounding the innate, complicated nature of the mother/daughter relationship, even in its absence.</desc>
