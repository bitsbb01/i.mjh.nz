    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <title>Uncut with Jay Cutler</title>
    <desc>Jay sits down with former teammate and friend Josh McCown, a journeyman quarterback who played alongside Jay in Chicago. Jay dives into Josh's coaching on the high school level, and what he carries into his HS job from his years in NFL systems. And of course with two seasoned quarterbacks, they get into today's QB play in the NFL, and how spread offenses are an accepted standard in today's game, and guys like Lamar Jackson need to adapt to becoming a pocket passer to extend his career. And as Josh's son goes through recruitment he jokes about how wildly different it is from when he and Jay were recruited. Plus both Jay and Josh get into how they've tried to approach football with their kids, and when is the right time to get them into pads and tackle. And it wouldn't be complete without Jay and Josh joking about their ping pong battles in Chicago, and how they approached their games as they got later in their careers. Make sure to follow Jay on Twitter (@JayHasTweets) and on Instagram (@ifjayhadinstagram) for the latest on the show!</desc>

    <desc>Today's pod opens with some KROQ memories, and the brilliant producing mind of Jimmy Kimmel. They go on to talk about the swing revival era of the mid 90s, and Adam talks about doing a father and son football draft with Sonny. Gina also shows the gang a clip from Cher's old TV show, and improvises a scene with Adam as 'Nancy Grace'. Brian Setzer then joins the show to share his own memories from recording a track for the KROQ Christmas Album, and going from a three-man-band to traveling with huge orchestras. Later they flash back to the history of Stray Cats, and they also talk about Brian's pet peeves. Before the break, Adam talks about the Kanye vs. Drake albums to contrast the orchestral music of Brian Setzer.
