    <title>Uncut with Jay Cutler</title>
    <desc>Jay is joined by ESPN mainstay Sage Steele, who dives into her upbringing as a military girl and how she got her start at the worldwide leader. She also jokes with Jay about hating Notre Dame because her first gig was in South Bend, and how nervous she was her first time on the air on television. Plus Sage recalls how difficult some men made it for her to make her way in sports, with rude comments and sexual undertones that would be shouted down in today's culture but instead she let it roll off her. Jay and Sage also align on their struggles with raising kids in a digital world, and how their kids individually torture them to test their limits. And did Sage really PASS on her first gig at ESPN? We also get into her Twitter attacks from a few years back when she tweeted her political stance and how scary that was for her family. Sage also admits that she just got her COVID vaccine because ESPN mandated it or she'd lose her job. Follow Jay on Twitter (@JayHasTweets) and Instagram (@IfJayHadInstagram) for more on the show and Jay's latest takes.</desc>
