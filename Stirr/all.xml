    <title>Uncut with Jay Cutler</title>
    <desc>Jay is joined by ESPN mainstay Sage Steele, who dives into her upbringing as a military girl and how she got her start at the worldwide leader. She also jokes with Jay about hating Notre Dame because her first gig was in South Bend, and how nervous she was her first time on the air on television. Plus Sage recalls how difficult some men made it for her to make her way in sports, with rude comments and sexual undertones that would be shouted down in today's culture but instead she let it roll off her. Jay and Sage also align on their struggles with raising kids in a digital world, and how their kids individually torture them to test their limits. And did Sage really PASS on her first gig at ESPN? We also get into her Twitter attacks from a few years back when she tweeted her political stance and how scary that was for her family. Sage also admits that she just got her COVID vaccine because ESPN mandated it or she'd lose her job. Follow Jay on Twitter (@JayHasTweets) and Instagram (@IfJayHadInstagram) for more on the show and Jay's latest takes.</desc>

Andrew, who has Cerebral Palsy and uses a wheelchair, remembers the excitement of going to a gay bar for the first time and the reality that sets in once he arrives. Jason was a ballet dancer during most of his teenage years and into his 20s. He was celebrated for being thin. During one of his first times at a gay bar, he was told he's too skinny and needed to put on some muscle, leading him down a path of taking testosterone and being unhappy. It wasn't until he realized he needed to be happy with who he was because &amp;amp;amp;quot;I wasnt happy pretending to be someone else.&amp;amp;amp;quot; Growing up in a religious household, Benjamine was concerned about having to come out to his mom not only as gay, but as the owner of the successful porn company CockyBoys and being in a polyamorous relationship with two other guys. What he learned from the experience was that honestly is the best thing in life. At 5 years old, Noah Michelson did a seductive dance in his underwear for the family's garbage man.

    <desc>Political Animals celebrates the legendary civil rights victories of four trailblazing California state politicians: Carole Migden, Sheila Keuhl, Jackie Goldberg, and Christine Kehoe. Fierce and unrelenting, these courageous women toppled a partisan majority and emerged victors to pass historic legislation for social justice and LGBT+ equality. It was a hard fight  filled with vehemently heated debates and hateful insults hurled by opponents.

Andrew, who has Cerebral Palsy and uses a wheelchair, remembers the excitement of going to a gay bar for the first time and the reality that sets in once he arrives. Jason was a ballet dancer during most of his teenage years and into his 20s. He was celebrated for being thin. During one of his first times at a gay bar, he was told he's too skinny and needed to put on some muscle, leading him down a path of taking testosterone and being unhappy.

    <title>Moving Stories</title>
    <desc>A film, by Rob Fruchtman, Cornelia Ravenal, Mikael Sdersten, Wendy Sax Six, about diverse dancers from the acclaimed Battery Dance Company who travel the world, working with youth who have experienced war, poverty, prejudice, sexual exploitation, and severe trauma as refugees. In India they work with girls rescued from sex trafficking and gender violence; in Romania, with gypsy kids from one of Europe's worst slums; in South Korea, with young North Koreans who risked their lives to escape; and in Iraq, with a gifted young Muslim dancer, fighting to survive. Incredibly, they have just one week to teach the tools of choreography and collaboration to kids who may be enemies, who may have been abused, who may be suspicious and fearful, so that they can create dances to perform for their communities. As they struggle to break through, the dancer-teachers confront their own frustrations. Yet their students respond in extraordinary ways - and as they prepare to perform in public in what seems an impossibly short time, both students and teachers experience surprising transformations, unlocking feelings and stories in wellsprings of creativity.</desc>

"America's Heartland" provides information about the people and processes responsible for the availability of food and fuel across the country and around the world. The show's reporters and producers tell stories in topics that include farm families, consumer issues, animal welfare and crop sustainability. Some episodes also take the show abroad to countries such as Egypt and Taiwan to show the impact American agriculture has on the global economy.</desc>
