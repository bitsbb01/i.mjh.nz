    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

Alexa moved from New York City to small-town Jackson, Mississippi, to teach at an under-priveleged school. After only two weeks in, Alexa had to challenge homophobia in the hallway, and had some surprising success. Megan's grandma was supportive and excited when she found out Megan was a lesbian. But after showing signs of Alzheimer's, Megan's grandma forgot and kept asking her if she was seeing any special boy. Megan received a special phone call from her grandma, though, that she'll remember forever. Jacob Tobia, activist for genderqueer, gender non-conforming, and transgender issues, bought a single pair of black pumps while organizing a Gender Nonconforming Day for their high school, a small act that would change the course of their life. After being kicked out of her home at 17, Angela Louis struggled with homelessness, abusive relationships, sex work, and depression, all while transitioning, but nothing could stop her from finding her own path and earning her diploma. Mila Jam had it all, or so she thought. Her drag persona, Britney Houston, had a massive YouTube following and she performed on a hit TV show in London. But she gave it all up so that she could finally live her truth as a woman and as herself. Olivia Page was brave enough to transition in high school. Unfortunately, a classmate decided to cyberbully her on Facebook. Olivia also had the support and kindness of a teacher who helped her through high school. A wild series of events led Sam to meeting the love of her life. Andre J. wants to tell you one thing: Love Yourself. That's how Andre went from being bullied in the projects to appearing on the cover of French Vogue. Alan Cumming remembers when he first felt an attraction to guys and how he came out to American media in a big way.

    <desc>Cued by the popular "The Librarian" trilogy, this series introduces new members of an ancient group protecting mystical artifacts. Hidden below the Metropolitan Public Library, the secret society's longtime leader is Flynn Carsen, whose job has become very complicated. To help, the Library recruits Eve, a counterterrorism agent responsible for organizational security; Jacob, who has encyclopedic knowledge of art, architecture and history; Cassandra, who links auditory/sensory hallucinations to memory; and Ezekiel, a skilled thief and master technician. Overseeing them is Jenkins, the reclusive caretaker of the Library's sleepy little annex in Oregon. Noah Wyle executive produces and recurs as Flynn, the role he played in the movie series.</desc>
