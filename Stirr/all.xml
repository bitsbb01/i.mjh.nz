    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

As we discovered these stories, we wished for a gay library where anyone could visit and learn, in bite-size portions, about crucial events in gay history, gay heroes and icons past and present, fascinating sub-cultures, slang terms, scientific references, political movements... Essentially, a record of all the bits of queer education that are at risk of being lost or misinterpreted  information that we all crave as members of LGBTQ communities and as Allies. Do you know the story of the first Pride parade? Ever wondered what Skoliosexual, Polycule, or Doppelbanger means? The Library is open  and ready to clue you in.</desc>

    <desc>Jay welcomes former NHL star Dan Carcillo about how he got started in hockey growing up in Canada, and how as an NHL player he doesn't remember his first FIVE concussions and how that damaged his long-term quality of life. Dan also talks about his savage nature on the ice and how he earned the nickname "Car Bomb", why he loved to fight, and how painkillers in his day were handed out to players like candy. We also talk about Dan's suicidal thoughts when he was heavily medicated, before he discovered mushrooms and what they could do for him, and is very candid about how far into depression he really spiraled. Plus his company's work with psychedelics and how they work in relation to brain injuries, and the road to approval for use on a larger scale.</desc>
