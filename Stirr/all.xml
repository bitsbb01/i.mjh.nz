    <desc>Two contestants, each teamed with a celebrity partner, compete in a word-association game. One player tries to guess a word based on clues offered by his or her partner. The game is timed, and if the clue-giver inadvertently says part of the word, a buzzer sounds and that round is lost. When the time is up, the team with the most points wins, and the non-celebrity contestants wins cash.</desc>

The film reveals how coming of age without their mothers has and continues to play a role in their lives. Structured around a series of dialogues featuring Rosie ODonnell, Molly Shannon and Jane Fonda that focus on various themes threading their stories together, these ruminations allow for heart-breaking and at times humorous insight into how ultimately ones past can dictate their future. From the cyclical nature of grief to their own mortality, the women of The Club provoke thoughts surrounding the innate, complicated nature of the mother/daughter relationship, even in its absence.</desc>

    <title>The Most Dangerous Year</title>
    <desc>As a dark wave of anti-transgender bathroom bills began sweeping across the nation, The Human Rights Campaign called 2016 the most dangerous year ever for transgender Americans. Filmmaker Vlada Knowlton captured the ensuing civil rights battle from the perspective of a group of embattled parents  including herself and her husband, parents of a young trans girl -- fighting to protect their children from discriminatory laws in their home state. While Knowlton passionately follows the story of anti-transgender legislation, the heart of the film lies in the stories of the families who accept and support their kids for exactly who they are.</desc>
