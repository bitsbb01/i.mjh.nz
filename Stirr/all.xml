The film reveals how coming of age without their mothers has and continues to play a role in their lives. Structured around a series of dialogues featuring Rosie ODonnell, Molly Shannon and Jane Fonda that focus on various themes threading their stories together, these ruminations allow for heart-breaking and at times humorous insight into how ultimately ones past can dictate their future. From the cyclical nature of grief to their own mortality, the women of The Club provoke thoughts surrounding the innate, complicated nature of the mother/daughter relationship, even in its absence.</desc>

While Knowlton passionately follows the story of anti-transgender legislation, the heart of the film lies in the stories of the families who accept and support their kids for exactly who they are.</desc>

    <desc>The Millennial Experience is one part dance-for-film and one part documentary. The film explores cultural appropriation vs appreciation, LGBTQIA+ culture, feminism and how these topics impact the Millennial generation. The dance sequences in the film are adapted from director Alex Crozier's stage production MILLENNIALS which focuses on the aforementioned themes. Fourteen on-camera interviews that expound on the main topics were conducted with people of various ages, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and genders . The Millennial Experience seeks to uplift the voices of women, LGBTQIA+, and BIPOC communities in an effort to create a more equitable and just world.</desc>
