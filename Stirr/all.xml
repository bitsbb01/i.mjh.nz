    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <desc>Two contestants, each teamed with a celebrity partner, compete in a word-association game. One player tries to guess a word based on clues offered by his or her partner. The game is timed, and if the clue-giver inadvertently says part of the word, a buzzer sounds and that round is lost. When the time is up, the team with the most points wins, and the non-celebrity contestants wins cash.</desc>

    <title>Drag Kids</title>
    <desc>Drag has always been about breaking down barriers and daring to do the unexpected. Now, a new type of queen is on the scene: shes fierce, shes living in a time of unprecedented access to queer culture, and shes younger than ever before. Shes a drag kid and shes a long way from the era of the queens who led the Stonewall Riots nearly 50 years ago. Stephan, Jason, Bracken and Nemis have never met, but theyre united by a shared passion for drag. They are about to come together for the first time  to perform Lady Gagas Born This Way at the world-famous Montreal Pride Festival. As they prepare for the big show, each faces their own unique challenges, as well as challenges they have in common - deep feelings of isolation and the struggle of trying to claim a place of your own on the fringes of a fringe culture. Drag Kids is a beautiful, daring, and touching portrait of four kids chasing freedom and friendship through the art of drag.</desc>

    <title>Drag Kids</title>
    <desc>Drag has always been about breaking down barriers and daring to do the unexpected. Now, a new type of queen is on the scene: shes fierce, shes living in a time of unprecedented access to queer culture, and shes younger than ever before. Shes a drag kid and shes a long way from the era of the queens who led the Stonewall Riots nearly 50 years ago. Stephan, Jason, Bracken and Nemis have never met, but theyre united by a shared passion for drag. They are about to come together for the first time  to perform Lady Gagas Born This Way at the world-famous Montreal Pride Festival. As they prepare for the big show, each faces their own unique challenges, as well as challenges they have in common - deep feelings of isolation and the struggle of trying to claim a place of your own on the fringes of a fringe culture. Drag Kids is a beautiful, daring, and touching portrait of four kids chasing freedom and friendship through the art of drag.</desc>

    <title>The Most Dangerous Year</title>
    <desc>As a dark wave of anti-transgender bathroom bills began sweeping across the nation, The Human Rights Campaign called 2016 the most dangerous year ever for transgender Americans. Filmmaker Vlada Knowlton captured the ensuing civil rights battle from the perspective of a group of embattled parents  including herself and her husband, parents of a young trans girl -- fighting to protect their children from discriminatory laws in their home state. While Knowlton passionately follows the story of anti-transgender legislation, the heart of the film lies in the stories of the families who accept and support their kids for exactly who they are.</desc>
