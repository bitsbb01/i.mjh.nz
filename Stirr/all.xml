    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

Overseeing them is Jenkins, the reclusive caretaker of the Library's sleepy little annex in Oregon. Noah Wyle executive produces and recurs as Flynn, the role he played in the movie series.</desc>

Andrew, who has Cerebral Palsy and uses a wheelchair, remembers the excitement of going to a gay bar for the first time and the reality that sets in once he arrives. Jason was a ballet dancer during most of his teenage years and into his 20s. He was celebrated for being thin. During one of his first times at a gay bar, he was told he's too skinny and needed to put on some muscle, leading him down a path of taking testosterone and being unhappy. It wasn't until he realized he needed to be happy with who he was because &amp;amp;amp;quot;I wasnt happy pretending to be someone else.&amp;amp;amp;quot; Growing up in a religious household, Benjamine was concerned about having to come out to his mom not only as gay, but as the owner of the successful porn company CockyBoys and being in a polyamorous relationship with two other guys. What he learned from the experience was that honestly is the best thing in life. At 5 years old, Noah Michelson did a seductive dance in his underwear for the family's garbage man. After being called &amp;amp;amp;quot;queer&amp;amp;amp;quot;, Noah finally had a word to define who he was and how he felt. Renee has always been a tomboy, and now identifies as queer. When Renee was a teen, a neighborhood mom noticed how Renee dressed and took them (Renee uses &amp;amp;amp;quot;they/them/their&amp;amp;amp;quot; pronouns) to The Gap to buy them feminine-looking pants. The experience was traumatic, but also transformational. From wearing Catholic school uniforms in childhood to menswear at a global bank, Erika Miguel has been all over the spectrum of gender expression and fashion. An inappropriate encounter at her job, related to her gender expression, led her to find a new job. Tori Baker went from a rough childhood to drugs to having a daughter and turning her life around. The turning point was realizing that she &amp;amp;amp;quot;can be who I am and like the people that I like. Mitch was afraid that the relationship might end, but knew it was time to tell his girlfriend that he's transgender. Not only did she support him, they're relationship grew stronger and eventually got married/ Only a few months before a study abroad trip to Rome, Charlie had begun hormone therapy and completed top surgery. He was nervous--about the language barrier and about passing as a male--when he walked into a small barbershop in Rome. Coming out leads to some embarrassing questions from this young man's mom.</desc>

    <title>Drag Kids</title>
    <desc>Drag has always been about breaking down barriers and daring to do the unexpected. Now, a new type of queen is on the scene: shes fierce, shes living in a time of unprecedented access to queer culture, and shes younger than ever before. Shes a drag kid and shes a long way from the era of the queens who led the Stonewall Riots nearly 50 years ago. Stephan, Jason, Bracken and Nemis have never met, but theyre united by a shared passion for drag. They are about to come together for the first time  to perform Lady Gagas Born This Way at the world-famous Montreal Pride Festival. As they prepare for the big show, each faces their own unique challenges, as well as challenges they have in common - deep feelings of isolation and the struggle of trying to claim a place of your own on the fringes of a fringe culture. Drag Kids is a beautiful, daring, and touching portrait of four kids chasing freedom and friendship through the art of drag.</desc>
