    <title>White Zombie</title>
    <desc>Murder Legendre (Bela Lugosi) is the menacingly named zombie master of Haiti. So it's to him that Charles Beaumont (Robert Frazer) goes when he needs help for a twisted plan. Spurned in marriage by Madeline Short (Madge Bellamy), Beaumont has decided on a simple solution: kill Short and bring her back as a zombie. Then she can be his forever. The only problem comes when Legendre keeps the fetching girl for himself -- and her new husband (John Harron) comes to Madeline's rescue.</desc>

    <title>The Invisible Ghost</title>
    <desc>Dr. Charles Kessler (Bela Lugosi), a well-to-do physician who shares his mansion with his daughter, Virginia (Polly Ann Young), has been depressed ever since his wife (Betty Compson) left him for another man, only to later die in a car accident. That's not all Kessler has to worry about, however. Unexplained murders have begun to occur around town, eventually claiming members of his house staff. Making matters worse, the authorities suspect Kessler may somehow be involved.</desc>

    <title>The Dead Mothers Club</title>
    <desc>The (Dead Mothers) Club tells the story of three women- a Southern artist redefining herself through her art; a high school senior struggling to gain independence; and a Brazilian living in NY, navigating first-time motherhood  all of whom lost their mothers during adolescence. The film reveals how coming of age without their mothers has and continues to play a role in their lives. Structured around a series of dialogues featuring Rosie ODonnell, Molly Shannon and Jane Fonda that focus on various themes threading their stories together, these ruminations allow for heart-breaking and at times humorous insight into how ultimately ones past can dictate their future. From the cyclical nature of grief to their own mortality, the women of The Club provoke thoughts surrounding the innate, complicated nature of the mother/daughter relationship, even in its absence.</desc>

Now, a new type of queen is on the scene: shes fierce, shes living in a time of unprecedented access to queer culture, and shes younger than ever before. Shes a drag kid and shes a long way from the era of the queens who led the Stonewall Riots nearly 50 years ago. Stephan, Jason, Bracken and Nemis have never met, but theyre united by a shared passion for drag. They are about to come together for the first time  to perform Lady Gagas Born This Way at the world-famous Montreal Pride Festival. As they prepare for the big show, each faces their own unique challenges, as well as challenges they have in common - deep feelings of isolation and the struggle of trying to claim a place of your own on the fringes of a fringe culture. Drag Kids is a beautiful, daring, and touching portrait of four kids chasing freedom and friendship through the art of drag.</desc>
