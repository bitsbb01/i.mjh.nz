    <desc>In a sickening coincidence -- or a sinister homage to actual crimes -- women are being murdered in Los Angeles 100 years after Jack the Ripper terrorized London. Police think John Westford (James Spader), a young doctor, is the murderer, and when he's found hanging from a noose, authorities believe his apparent suicide is a tacit admission of guilt. But his twin brother, Rick (also Spader), insists John was killed, and, when it appears Rick is right, the investigation takes a stunning turn.</desc>

While Knowlton passionately follows the story of anti-transgender legislation, the heart of the film lies in the stories of the families who accept and support their kids for exactly who they are.</desc>

As we discovered these stories, we wished for a gay library where anyone could visit and learn, in bite-size portions, about crucial events in gay history, gay heroes and icons past and present, fascinating sub-cultures, slang terms, scientific references, political movements... Essentially, a record of all the bits of queer education that are at risk of being lost or misinterpreted  information that we all crave as members of LGBTQ communities and as Allies.
