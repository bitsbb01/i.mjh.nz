    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <title>Uncut with Jay Cutler</title>
    <desc>Jay sits down with former teammate and friend Josh McCown, a journeyman quarterback who played alongside Jay in Chicago. Jay dives into Josh's coaching on the high school level, and what he carries into his HS job from his years in NFL systems. And of course with two seasoned quarterbacks, they get into today's QB play in the NFL, and how spread offenses are an accepted standard in today's game, and guys like Lamar Jackson need to adapt to becoming a pocket passer to extend his career. And as Josh's son goes through recruitment he jokes about how wildly different it is from when he and Jay were recruited. Plus both Jay and Josh get into how they've tried to approach football with their kids, and when is the right time to get them into pads and tackle. And it wouldn't be complete without Jay and Josh joking about their ping pong battles in Chicago, and how they approached their games as they got later in their careers. Make sure to follow Jay on Twitter (@JayHasTweets) and on Instagram (@ifjayhadinstagram) for the latest on the show!</desc>

    <title>The Adam Carolla Show</title>
    <desc>Today's pod opens with some KROQ memories, and the brilliant producing mind of Jimmy Kimmel. They go on to talk about the swing revival era of the mid 90s, and Adam talks about doing a father and son football draft with Sonny. Gina also shows the gang a clip from Cher's old TV show, and improvises a scene with Adam as 'Nancy Grace'. Brian Setzer then joins the show to share his own memories from recording a track for the KROQ Christmas Album, and going from a three-man-band to traveling with huge orchestras. Later they flash back to the history of Stray Cats, and they also talk about Brian's pet peeves. Before the break, Adam talks about the Kanye vs. Drake albums to contrast the orchestral music of Brian Setzer.

    <title>Nappy Boy Radio with T-Pain</title>
    <desc>Atlanta's very own EarthGang stopped by to chat with T-Pain about exactly what they've been up to during the pandemic. Olu (AKA Johnny Venus) and WowGr8 (AKA Doctur Dot) get into it as they sip on their custom cocktails. J. Cole's basketball stint left them wondering are athletes able to crossover into music the same way musicians are able to crossover into sports? Listerine is definitely repurposed floor cleaner. WowGr8 confesses to watching HGTV (on YouTube nonetheless) and they get into the Caucasian appeal of rock legend Lenny Kravitz. Who are your top five groups of all time and why doesn't it include the Jedi Council? Check out this absolutely bonkers episode of T-Pain's Nappy Boy Radio Podcast!</desc>

    <title>The Guys Next Door</title>
    <desc>Who, among us, can say that we come from a normal family? The Guys Next Door, a feature length documentary, offers an alternative to the traditional ideas of what constitute the nuclear American family. Meet Erik and Sandro, a gay couple with two daughters birthed by their friend Rachel with donor eggs. In her 40s, Rachel is married to Tony and they have three biological children of their own. Rachel and Tony, a seemingly traditional married couple, live in the suburbs of Massachusetts with their children. Inspired by a TV program about the difficulties and costs associated with gay couples having children, Rachel, age 41, volunteers to be a surrogate  not once, but twice within two years  for Erik, her good friend from college, and his husband Sandro, an Italian migr. This film begins when Rachel is eight months pregnant with Erik and Sandros second daughter, Eleonora. What compels a woman in her forties with three children of her own to carry children for friends? What is the reaction of her husband and children? And, how will Erik and Sandro handle the challenges of parenting two girls in a world that still emphasizes the importance of maternal instinct? The issues raised in this film - gay marriage and parenting, surrogacy as a path for gays and lesbians to have children, and the extension and redefinition of what it means to be an American family&amp;amp;amp;quot; - remain relevant as our country is a cultural battleground during the divisive 2016 presidential election. The Guys Next Door is a powerful antidote to the negative backlash and hateful rhetoric aimed at same sex families. In the words of the esteemed documentary filmmaker Ross McElwee (Shermans March), with nuance, verve and humor, this film goes well beyond issues of surrogacy and gay parenthood and explores the humanity that connects us all.&amp;amp;amp;quot;</desc>

    <title>TransMilitary</title>
    <desc>The 2018 SXSW Audience Award-winning feature film debut by Gabriel Silverman, Fiona Dawson, &amp;amp;amp; Jamie Coughlin, TransMilitary follows the Emmy-nominated short film Transgender, at War and in Love. Around 15,500 transgender people serve in the U.S. military (notably the largest transgender employer in the U.S.), where they must conceal their gender identity because military policies ban their service. TransMilitary chronicles the lives of four individuals (Senior Airman Logan Ireland, Corporal Laila Villanueva, Captain Jennifer Peace &amp;amp;amp; First Lieutenant El Cook) defending their countrys freedom while fighting for their own. They put their careers and their families livelihoods on the line by coming out as transgender to top brass officials in the Pentagon in hopes of attaining the equal right to serve. The ban was lifted in 2016, but with President Trump now trying to reinstate it, their futures hang in the balance once again.</desc>
