    <title>Uncut with Jay Cutler</title>
    <desc>Jay is joined by ESPN mainstay Sage Steele, who dives into her upbringing as a military girl and how she got her start at the worldwide leader. She also jokes with Jay about hating Notre Dame because her first gig was in South Bend, and how nervous she was her first time on the air on television. Plus Sage recalls how difficult some men made it for her to make her way in sports, with rude comments and sexual undertones that would be shouted down in today's culture but instead she let it roll off her. Jay and Sage also align on their struggles with raising kids in a digital world, and how their kids individually torture them to test their limits. And did Sage really PASS on her first gig at ESPN? We also get into her Twitter attacks from a few years back when she tweeted her political stance and how scary that was for her family. Sage also admits that she just got her COVID vaccine because ESPN mandated it or she'd lose her job. Follow Jay on Twitter (@JayHasTweets) and Instagram (@IfJayHadInstagram) for more on the show and Jay's latest takes.</desc>

    <desc>Lucky episode number 13! Superstar Rotimi and his arms stop by T-Pain's Nappy Boy Radio Podcast for an adventure-filled episode. They go behind the scenes to get to the bottom of what actually happened when Rotimi found out about his character (spoiler alert?) on Power. Sometimes you just have to trust the creative process. Song of the week is the latest hit from Rotimi himself "What To Do." Amigo asks Rotimi his top 5 cinema moments of all time and yes The Matrix and Star Wars (more specifically Yoda) made the cut. Tune in to find out more and how to navigate a barber who gets too close during a cut. </desc>

    <title>The Guys Next Door</title>
    <desc>Who, among us, can say that we come from a normal family? The Guys Next Door, a feature length documentary, offers an alternative to the traditional ideas of what constitute the nuclear American family. Meet Erik and Sandro, a gay couple with two daughters birthed by their friend Rachel with donor eggs. In her 40s, Rachel is married to Tony and they have three biological children of their own. Rachel and Tony, a seemingly traditional married couple, live in the suburbs of Massachusetts with their children. Inspired by a TV program about the difficulties and costs associated with gay couples having children, Rachel, age 41, volunteers to be a surrogate  not once, but twice within two years  for Erik, her good friend from college, and his husband Sandro, an Italian migr. This film begins when Rachel is eight months pregnant with Erik and Sandros second daughter, Eleonora. What compels a woman in her forties with three children of her own to carry children for friends? What is the reaction of her husband and children? And, how will Erik and Sandro handle the challenges of parenting two girls in a world that still emphasizes the importance of maternal instinct? The issues raised in this film - gay marriage and parenting, surrogacy as a path for gays and lesbians to have children, and the extension and redefinition of what it means to be an American family&amp;amp;amp;quot; - remain relevant as our country is a cultural battleground during the divisive 2016 presidential election. The Guys Next Door is a powerful antidote to the negative backlash and hateful rhetoric aimed at same sex families. In the words of the esteemed documentary filmmaker Ross McElwee (Shermans March), with nuance, verve and humor, this film goes well beyond issues of surrogacy and gay parenthood and explores the humanity that connects us all.&amp;amp;amp;quot;</desc>

    <title>A Very Sordid Wedding</title>
    <desc>Seventeen years after family matriarch Peggy tripped over G.W.s wooden legs in Sordid Lives, same-sex marriage equality has barreled into Winters, Texas and not everyone is ready to accept it. An anniversary memorial service is being planned in honor of Peggy at the bar while the Southside Baptist Church plans an &amp;amp;amp;quot;Anti-Equality&amp;amp;amp;quot; rally to protest the abomination of gay marriage and work to defend their religious freedom. The beloved cast of colorful characters are all on a collision course for shenanigans and fireworks on the big night. Along the way a bisexual serial killer shows up, a drag queen country medley is performed and a beauty-salon-versus-the-bigots battle turns getting your hair done into the front lines of the equality battle.  Friendships are tested and families are reunited as fear and bigotry are confronted with acceptance and understanding on the way to a surprise wedding with (almost) everyone in attendance.</desc>

Andrew, who has Cerebral Palsy and uses a wheelchair, remembers the excitement of going to a gay bar for the first time and the reality that sets in once he arrives. Jason was a ballet dancer during most of his teenage years and into his 20s. He was celebrated for being thin. During one of his first times at a gay bar, he was told he's too skinny and needed to put on some muscle, leading him down a path of taking testosterone and being unhappy. It wasn't until he realized he needed to be happy with who he was because &amp;amp;amp;quot;I wasnt happy pretending to be someone else.&amp;amp;amp;quot; Growing up in a religious household, Benjamine was concerned about having to come out to his mom not only as gay, but as the owner of the successful porn company CockyBoys and being in a polyamorous relationship with two other guys. What he learned from the experience was that honestly is the best thing in life. At 5 years old, Noah Michelson did a seductive dance in his underwear for the family's garbage man. After being called &amp;amp;amp;quot;queer&amp;amp;amp;quot;, Noah finally had a word to define who he was and how he felt. Renee has always been a tomboy, and now identifies as queer. When Renee was a teen, a neighborhood mom noticed how Renee dressed and took them (Renee uses &amp;amp;amp;quot;they/them/their&amp;amp;amp;quot; pronouns) to The Gap to buy them feminine-looking pants. The experience was traumatic, but also transformational. From wearing Catholic school uniforms in childhood to menswear at a global bank, Erika Miguel has been all over the spectrum of gender expression and fashion. An inappropriate encounter at her job, related to her gender expression, led her to find a new job. Tori Baker went from a rough childhood to drugs to having a daughter and turning her life around. The turning point was realizing that she &amp;amp;amp;quot;can be who I am and like the people that I like. Mitch was afraid that the relationship might end, but knew it was time to tell his girlfriend that he's transgender. Not only did she support him, they're relationship grew stronger and eventually got married/ Only a few months before a study abroad trip to Rome, Charlie had begun hormone therapy and completed top surgery. He was nervous--about the language barrier and about passing as a male--when he walked into a small barbershop in Rome. Coming out leads to some embarrassing questions from this young man's mom.</desc>

Fierce and unrelenting, these courageous women toppled a partisan majority and emerged victors to pass historic legislation for social justice and LGBT+ equality. It was a hard fight  filled with vehemently heated debates and hateful insults hurled by opponents. Today, the message behind Political Animals is more important than ever as the current political theatre unfurls around the globe. These inspiring biographies further reveal the critical importance for public resistance at the local level to pressure lawmakers to enact difficult change.

    <desc>S1 E24 | This week on Culture Q we dive into the world of Super Queer-oes, looking at DC's bisexual Superman and trans Wonder Woman character, as well as other upcoming projects like Marvel's The Eternals and Thor: Love and Thunder. Later we take a look at the Netflix employee walkout over Dave Chappelle's special The Closer, hearing from the employees affected as well as stars like Johnathan Van Ness and Our Lady J, before we sit down to interview Bowen Yang about his time on Saturday Night Live. Next, we congratulate Admiral Rachel Levine for becoming the first trans and the first female four-star officer in the US, and then go global looking at mounting tensions in Ghana, Russia, and Afghanistan. Finally we celebrate Jamie Lee Curtis's daughter Ruby coming out as trans, and look at Curtis's history with the Human Rights Campaign, and her upcoming biopic based on the woman who founded the Free Mom Hugs organization.</desc>
