    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <desc>Two contestants, each teamed with a celebrity partner, compete in a word-association game. One player tries to guess a word based on clues offered by his or her partner. The game is timed, and if the clue-giver inadvertently says part of the word, a buzzer sounds and that round is lost. When the time is up, the team with the most points wins, and the non-celebrity contestants wins cash.</desc>

Plus Eric and Brett break down their new NFT adventures, and Brett even talks about some of the exclusive items he has on deck including an autographed Bart Starr photo that he had made.

    <desc>Political Animals celebrates the legendary civil rights victories of four trailblazing California state politicians: Carole Migden, Sheila Keuhl, Jackie Goldberg, and Christine Kehoe. Fierce and unrelenting, these courageous women toppled a partisan majority and emerged victors to pass historic legislation for social justice and LGBT+ equality. It was a hard fight  filled with vehemently heated debates and hateful insults hurled by opponents. Today, the message behind Political Animals is more important than ever as the current political theatre unfurls around the globe. These inspiring biographies further reveal the critical importance for public resistance at the local level to pressure lawmakers to enact difficult change. Political Animals is a clear call to action for a new era of greater democratic participation. We invite you to follow in the footsteps of these historic leaders and become the next pioneering political animal!</desc>

    <title>The Guys Next Door</title>
    <desc>Who, among us, can say that we come from a normal family? The Guys Next Door, a feature length documentary, offers an alternative to the traditional ideas of what constitute the nuclear American family. Meet Erik and Sandro, a gay couple with two daughters birthed by their friend Rachel with donor eggs. In her 40s, Rachel is married to Tony and they have three biological children of their own. Rachel and Tony, a seemingly traditional married couple, live in the suburbs of Massachusetts with their children. Inspired by a TV program about the difficulties and costs associated with gay couples having children, Rachel, age 41, volunteers to be a surrogate  not once, but twice within two years  for Erik, her good friend from college, and his husband Sandro, an Italian migr. This film begins when Rachel is eight months pregnant with Erik and Sandros second daughter, Eleonora. What compels a woman in her forties with three children of her own to carry children for friends? What is the reaction of her husband and children? And, how will Erik and Sandro handle the challenges of parenting two girls in a world that still emphasizes the importance of maternal instinct? The issues raised in this film - gay marriage and parenting, surrogacy as a path for gays and lesbians to have children, and the extension and redefinition of what it means to be an American family&amp;amp;amp;quot; - remain relevant as our country is a cultural battleground during the divisive 2016 presidential election. The Guys Next Door is a powerful antidote to the negative backlash and hateful rhetoric aimed at same sex families. In the words of the esteemed documentary filmmaker Ross McElwee (Shermans March), with nuance, verve and humor, this film goes well beyond issues of surrogacy and gay parenthood and explores the humanity that connects us all.&amp;amp;amp;quot;</desc>
