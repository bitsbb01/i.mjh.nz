    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

Hidden below the Metropolitan Public Library, the secret society's longtime leader is Flynn Carsen, whose job has become very complicated. To help, the Library recruits Eve, a counterterrorism agent responsible for organizational security; Jacob, who has encyclopedic knowledge of art, architecture and history; Cassandra, who links auditory/sensory hallucinations to memory; and Ezekiel, a skilled thief and master technician. Overseeing them is Jenkins, the reclusive caretaker of the Library's sleepy little annex in Oregon. Noah Wyle executive produces and recurs as Flynn, the role he played in the movie series.</desc>

    <desc>Cued by the popular "The Librarian" trilogy, this series introduces new members of an ancient group protecting mystical artifacts. Hidden below the Metropolitan Public Library, the secret society's longtime leader is Flynn Carsen, whose job has become very complicated. To help, the Library recruits Eve, a counterterrorism agent responsible for organizational security; Jacob, who has encyclopedic knowledge of art, architecture and history; Cassandra, who links auditory/sensory hallucinations to memory; and Ezekiel, a skilled thief and master technician. Overseeing them is Jenkins, the reclusive caretaker of the Library's sleepy little annex in Oregon. Noah Wyle executive produces and recurs as Flynn, the role he played in the movie series.</desc>

    <title>Uncut with Jay Cutler</title>
    <desc>Jay sits down with former teammate and friend Josh McCown, a journeyman quarterback who played alongside Jay in Chicago. Jay dives into Josh's coaching on the high school level, and what he carries into his HS job from his years in NFL systems. And of course with two seasoned quarterbacks, they get into today's QB play in the NFL, and how spread offenses are an accepted standard in today's game, and guys like Lamar Jackson need to adapt to becoming a pocket passer to extend his career. And as Josh's son goes through recruitment he jokes about how wildly different it is from when he and Jay were recruited. Plus both Jay and Josh get into how they've tried to approach football with their kids, and when is the right time to get them into pads and tackle. And it wouldn't be complete without Jay and Josh joking about their ping pong battles in Chicago, and how they approached their games as they got later in their careers. Make sure to follow Jay on Twitter (@JayHasTweets) and on Instagram (@ifjayhadinstagram) for the latest on the show!</desc>

    <desc>Drag has always been about breaking down barriers and daring to do the unexpected. Now, a new type of queen is on the scene: shes fierce, shes living in a time of unprecedented access to queer culture, and shes younger than ever before. Shes a drag kid and shes a long way from the era of the queens who led the Stonewall Riots nearly 50 years ago. Stephan, Jason, Bracken and Nemis have never met, but theyre united by a shared passion for drag. They are about to come together for the first time  to perform Lady Gagas Born This Way at the world-famous Montreal Pride Festival. As they prepare for the big show, each faces their own unique challenges, as well as challenges they have in common - deep feelings of isolation and the struggle of trying to claim a place of your own on the fringes of a fringe culture. Drag Kids is a beautiful, daring, and touching portrait of four kids chasing freedom and friendship through the art of drag.</desc>
