    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

Now, a new type of queen is on the scene: shes fierce, shes living in a time of unprecedented access to queer culture, and shes younger than ever before. Shes a drag kid and shes a long way from the era of the queens who led the Stonewall Riots nearly 50 years ago. Stephan, Jason, Bracken and Nemis have never met, but theyre united by a shared passion for drag. They are about to come together for the first time  to perform Lady Gagas Born This Way at the world-famous Montreal Pride Festival. As they prepare for the big show, each faces their own unique challenges, as well as challenges they have in common - deep feelings of isolation and the struggle of trying to claim a place of your own on the fringes of a fringe culture. Drag Kids is a beautiful, daring, and touching portrait of four kids chasing freedom and friendship through the art of drag.</desc>
