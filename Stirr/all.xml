The game is timed, and if the clue-giver inadvertently says part of the word, a buzzer sounds and that round is lost. When the time is up, the team with the most points wins, and the non-celebrity contestants wins cash.</desc>

    <title>The Guys Next Door</title>
    <desc>Who, among us, can say that we come from a normal family? The Guys Next Door, a feature length documentary, offers an alternative to the traditional ideas of what constitute the nuclear American family. Meet Erik and Sandro, a gay couple with two daughters birthed by their friend Rachel with donor eggs. In her 40s, Rachel is married to Tony and they have three biological children of their own. Rachel and Tony, a seemingly traditional married couple, live in the suburbs of Massachusetts with their children. Inspired by a TV program about the difficulties and costs associated with gay couples having children, Rachel, age 41, volunteers to be a surrogate  not once, but twice within two years  for Erik, her good friend from college, and his husband Sandro, an Italian migr. This film begins when Rachel is eight months pregnant with Erik and Sandros second daughter, Eleonora. What compels a woman in her forties with three children of her own to carry children for friends? What is the reaction of her husband and children? And, how will Erik and Sandro handle the challenges of parenting two girls in a world that still emphasizes the importance of maternal instinct? The issues raised in this film - gay marriage and parenting, surrogacy as a path for gays and lesbians to have children, and the extension and redefinition of what it means to be an American family&amp;amp;amp;quot; - remain relevant as our country is a cultural battleground during the divisive 2016 presidential election. The Guys Next Door is a powerful antidote to the negative backlash and hateful rhetoric aimed at same sex families. In the words of the esteemed documentary filmmaker Ross McElwee (Shermans March), with nuance, verve and humor, this film goes well beyond issues of surrogacy and gay parenthood and explores the humanity that connects us all.&amp;amp;amp;quot;</desc>

    <title>Memories Of A Penitent Heart</title>
    <desc>Combining a wealth of recently discovered home movies, video, and written documents with artfully shot contemporary interviews and vrit footage, Memories Of A Penitent Heart is a documentary that cracks open a Pandoras box of unresolved family drama. Originating from filmmaker Cecilia Aldarondos suspicion that there was something ugly in her familys past, the film charts her excavation of the buried family conflict around her uncle Miguels death, and her search for Miguels partner Robert a generation later. After two years of dead ends, Robert turns up: but hes not the same man. Hes reinvented himself as Father Aquin, a Franciscan monk with twenty-five years of pent-up grief and bitterness. For the first time, a member of Miguels family wants to hear Aquins side of the storybut is it too little, too late? A story about the mistakes of the past and the second chances of the present, Memories Of A Penitent Heart is a cautionary tale about the unresolved conflicts wrought by AIDS, and a nuanced exploration of how faith is used and abused in times of crisis.</desc>

    <title>Uncut with Jay Cutler</title>
    <desc>Jay is joined by ESPN mainstay Sage Steele, who dives into her upbringing as a military girl and how she got her start at the worldwide leader. She also jokes with Jay about hating Notre Dame because her first gig was in South Bend, and how nervous she was her first time on the air on television. Plus Sage recalls how difficult some men made it for her to make her way in sports, with rude comments and sexual undertones that would be shouted down in today's culture but instead she let it roll off her. Jay and Sage also align on their struggles with raising kids in a digital world, and how their kids individually torture them to test their limits. And did Sage really PASS on her first gig at ESPN? We also get into her Twitter attacks from a few years back when she tweeted her political stance and how scary that was for her family. Sage also admits that she just got her COVID vaccine because ESPN mandated it or she'd lose her job. Follow Jay on Twitter (@JayHasTweets) and Instagram (@IfJayHadInstagram) for more on the show and Jay's latest takes.</desc>

"America's Heartland" provides information about the people and processes responsible for the availability of food and fuel across the country and around the world. The show's reporters and producers tell stories in topics that include farm families, consumer issues, animal welfare and crop sustainability. Some episodes also take the show abroad to countries such as Egypt and Taiwan to show the impact American agriculture has on the global economy.</desc>

    <title>America's Heartland</title>
    <desc>Much of the food Americans eat is produced by farmers and ranchers in the country's heartland, but many people don't know how it's produced. "America's Heartland" provides information about the people and processes responsible for the availability of food and fuel across the country and around the world. The show's reporters and producers tell stories in topics that include farm families, consumer issues, animal welfare and crop sustainability. Some episodes also take the show abroad to countries such as Egypt and Taiwan to show the impact American agriculture has on the global economy.</desc>
