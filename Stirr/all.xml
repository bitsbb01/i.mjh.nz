    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <desc>Cued by the popular "The Librarian" trilogy, this series introduces new members of an ancient group protecting mystical artifacts. Hidden below the Metropolitan Public Library, the secret society's longtime leader is Flynn Carsen, whose job has become very complicated. To help, the Library recruits Eve, a counterterrorism agent responsible for organizational security; Jacob, who has encyclopedic knowledge of art, architecture and history; Cassandra, who links auditory/sensory hallucinations to memory; and Ezekiel, a skilled thief and master technician. Overseeing them is Jenkins, the reclusive caretaker of the Library's sleepy little annex in Oregon. Noah Wyle executive produces and recurs as Flynn, the role he played in the movie series.</desc>

    <title>Uncut with Jay Cutler</title>
    <desc>Jay welcomes former NHL star Dan Carcillo about how he got started in hockey growing up in Canada, and how as an NHL player he doesn't remember his first FIVE concussions and how that damaged his long-term quality of life. Dan also talks about his savage nature on the ice and how he earned the nickname "Car Bomb", why he loved to fight, and how painkillers in his day were handed out to players like candy. We also talk about Dan's suicidal thoughts when he was heavily medicated, before he discovered mushrooms and what they could do for him, and is very candid about how far into depression he really spiraled. Plus his company's work with psychedelics and how they work in relation to brain injuries, and the road to approval for use on a larger scale.</desc>

Structured around a series of dialogues featuring Rosie ODonnell, Molly Shannon and Jane Fonda that focus on various themes threading their stories together, these ruminations allow for heart-breaking and at times humorous insight into how ultimately ones past can dictate their future. From the cyclical nature of grief to their own mortality, the women of The Club provoke thoughts surrounding the innate, complicated nature of the mother/daughter relationship, even in its absence.</desc>

    <desc>Roping and riding across North America, the International Gay Rodeo Association's courageous cowboys and cowgirls brave challenges both in and out of the arena on their quest to qualify for the World Finals. Along the way, theyll bust every stereotype in the book. The film tells the story of five members of the IGRA. From Wade Earp, a descendant of cowboy legend Wyatt Earp and one of the best competitors on the circuit, to Char Duran, a female bull rider whos never won a buckle but seems determined to die trying, QUEENS &amp;amp;amp; COWBOYS weaves the stories of its protagonists over the course of an entire rabble-rousing year. An unprecedented look at the strength it takes to be gay in the rural west, this film explores the many struggles threatening the IGRA and the gay community at large, how far society has come on the subject of gay equality, and how far we still have to go.</desc>

    <title>The Guys Next Door</title>
    <desc>Who, among us, can say that we come from a normal family? The Guys Next Door, a feature length documentary, offers an alternative to the traditional ideas of what constitute the nuclear American family. Meet Erik and Sandro, a gay couple with two daughters birthed by their friend Rachel with donor eggs. In her 40s, Rachel is married to Tony and they have three biological children of their own. Rachel and Tony, a seemingly traditional married couple, live in the suburbs of Massachusetts with their children. Inspired by a TV program about the difficulties and costs associated with gay couples having children, Rachel, age 41, volunteers to be a surrogate  not once, but twice within two years  for Erik, her good friend from college, and his husband Sandro, an Italian migr. This film begins when Rachel is eight months pregnant with Erik and Sandros second daughter, Eleonora. What compels a woman in her forties with three children of her own to carry children for friends? What is the reaction of her husband and children? And, how will Erik and Sandro handle the challenges of parenting two girls in a world that still emphasizes the importance of maternal instinct? The issues raised in this film - gay marriage and parenting, surrogacy as a path for gays and lesbians to have children, and the extension and redefinition of what it means to be an American family&amp;amp;amp;quot; - remain relevant as our country is a cultural battleground during the divisive 2016 presidential election. The Guys Next Door is a powerful antidote to the negative backlash and hateful rhetoric aimed at same sex families. In the words of the esteemed documentary filmmaker Ross McElwee (Shermans March), with nuance, verve and humor, this film goes well beyond issues of surrogacy and gay parenthood and explores the humanity that connects us all.&amp;amp;amp;quot;</desc>

    <title>Memories Of A Penitent Heart</title>
    <desc>Combining a wealth of recently discovered home movies, video, and written documents with artfully shot contemporary interviews and vrit footage, Memories Of A Penitent Heart is a documentary that cracks open a Pandoras box of unresolved family drama. Originating from filmmaker Cecilia Aldarondos suspicion that there was something ugly in her familys past, the film charts her excavation of the buried family conflict around her uncle Miguels death, and her search for Miguels partner Robert a generation later. After two years of dead ends, Robert turns up: but hes not the same man. Hes reinvented himself as Father Aquin, a Franciscan monk with twenty-five years of pent-up grief and bitterness. For the first time, a member of Miguels family wants to hear Aquins side of the storybut is it too little, too late? A story about the mistakes of the past and the second chances of the present, Memories Of A Penitent Heart is a cautionary tale about the unresolved conflicts wrought by AIDS, and a nuanced exploration of how faith is used and abused in times of crisis.</desc>
