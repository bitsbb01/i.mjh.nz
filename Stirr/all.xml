    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <desc>While a class is discussing what is known and what should remain unknown, a high school teacher named Roger Mason (Bob Clymire) tells the students a horrifying story from his youth.

Inevitably, the mummy, which was really a monster, came alive and proceeded to terrorize the area.</desc>

    <desc>Jay is joined by ESPN mainstay Sage Steele, who dives into her upbringing as a military girl and how she got her start at the worldwide leader. She also jokes with Jay about hating Notre Dame because her first gig was in South Bend, and how nervous she was her first time on the air on television. Plus Sage recalls how difficult some men made it for her to make her way in sports, with rude comments and sexual undertones that would be shouted down in today's culture but instead she let it roll off her. Jay and Sage also align on their struggles with raising kids in a digital world, and how their kids individually torture them to test their limits. And did Sage really PASS on her first gig at ESPN? We also get into her Twitter attacks from a few years back when she tweeted her political stance and how scary that was for her family. Sage also admits that she just got her COVID vaccine because ESPN mandated it or she'd lose her job.

    <title>The Guys Next Door</title>
    <desc>Who, among us, can say that we come from a normal family? The Guys Next Door, a feature length documentary, offers an alternative to the traditional ideas of what constitute the nuclear American family. Meet Erik and Sandro, a gay couple with two daughters birthed by their friend Rachel with donor eggs. In her 40s, Rachel is married to Tony and they have three biological children of their own. Rachel and Tony, a seemingly traditional married couple, live in the suburbs of Massachusetts with their children. Inspired by a TV program about the difficulties and costs associated with gay couples having children, Rachel, age 41, volunteers to be a surrogate  not once, but twice within two years  for Erik, her good friend from college, and his husband Sandro, an Italian migr. This film begins when Rachel is eight months pregnant with Erik and Sandros second daughter, Eleonora. What compels a woman in her forties with three children of her own to carry children for friends? What is the reaction of her husband and children? And, how will Erik and Sandro handle the challenges of parenting two girls in a world that still emphasizes the importance of maternal instinct? The issues raised in this film - gay marriage and parenting, surrogacy as a path for gays and lesbians to have children, and the extension and redefinition of what it means to be an American family&amp;amp;amp;quot; - remain relevant as our country is a cultural battleground during the divisive 2016 presidential election. The Guys Next Door is a powerful antidote to the negative backlash and hateful rhetoric aimed at same sex families. In the words of the esteemed documentary filmmaker Ross McElwee (Shermans March), with nuance, verve and humor, this film goes well beyond issues of surrogacy and gay parenthood and explores the humanity that connects us all.&amp;amp;amp;quot;</desc>

    <title>A Very Sordid Wedding</title>
    <desc>Seventeen years after family matriarch Peggy tripped over G.W.s wooden legs in Sordid Lives, same-sex marriage equality has barreled into Winters, Texas and not everyone is ready to accept it. An anniversary memorial service is being planned in honor of Peggy at the bar while the Southside Baptist Church plans an &amp;amp;amp;quot;Anti-Equality&amp;amp;amp;quot; rally to protest the abomination of gay marriage and work to defend their religious freedom. The beloved cast of colorful characters are all on a collision course for shenanigans and fireworks on the big night. Along the way a bisexual serial killer shows up, a drag queen country medley is performed and a beauty-salon-versus-the-bigots battle turns getting your hair done into the front lines of the equality battle.  Friendships are tested and families are reunited as fear and bigotry are confronted with acceptance and understanding on the way to a surprise wedding with (almost) everyone in attendance.</desc>

Andrew, who has Cerebral Palsy and uses a wheelchair, remembers the excitement of going to a gay bar for the first time and the reality that sets in once he arrives. Jason was a ballet dancer during most of his teenage years and into his 20s. He was celebrated for being thin. During one of his first times at a gay bar, he was told he's too skinny and needed to put on some muscle, leading him down a path of taking testosterone and being unhappy. It wasn't until he realized he needed to be happy with who he was because &amp;amp;amp;quot;I wasnt happy pretending to be someone else.&amp;amp;amp;quot; Growing up in a religious household, Benjamine was concerned about having to come out to his mom not only as gay, but as the owner of the successful porn company CockyBoys and being in a polyamorous relationship with two other guys. What he learned from the experience was that honestly is the best thing in life. At 5 years old, Noah Michelson did a seductive dance in his underwear for the family's garbage man. After being called &amp;amp;amp;quot;queer&amp;amp;amp;quot;, Noah finally had a word to define who he was and how he felt. Renee has always been a tomboy, and now identifies as queer. When Renee was a teen, a neighborhood mom noticed how Renee dressed and took them (Renee uses &amp;amp;amp;quot;they/them/their&amp;amp;amp;quot; pronouns) to The Gap to buy them feminine-looking pants. The experience was traumatic, but also transformational. From wearing Catholic school uniforms in childhood to menswear at a global bank, Erika Miguel has been all over the spectrum of gender expression and fashion. An inappropriate encounter at her job, related to her gender expression, led her to find a new job. Tori Baker went from a rough childhood to drugs to having a daughter and turning her life around. The turning point was realizing that she &amp;amp;amp;quot;can be who I am and like the people that I like. Mitch was afraid that the relationship might end, but knew it was time to tell his girlfriend that he's transgender. Not only did she support him, they're relationship grew stronger and eventually got married/ Only a few months before a study abroad trip to Rome, Charlie had begun hormone therapy and completed top surgery. He was nervous--about the language barrier and about passing as a male--when he walked into a small barbershop in Rome. Coming out leads to some embarrassing questions from this young man's mom.</desc>

    <desc>Political Animals celebrates the legendary civil rights victories of four trailblazing California state politicians: Carole Migden, Sheila Keuhl, Jackie Goldberg, and Christine Kehoe. Fierce and unrelenting, these courageous women toppled a partisan majority and emerged victors to pass historic legislation for social justice and LGBT+ equality. It was a hard fight  filled with vehemently heated debates and hateful insults hurled by opponents. Today, the message behind Political Animals is more important than ever as the current political theatre unfurls around the globe. These inspiring biographies further reveal the critical importance for public resistance at the local level to pressure lawmakers to enact difficult change. Political Animals is a clear call to action for a new era of greater democratic participation.

Andrew, who has Cerebral Palsy and uses a wheelchair, remembers the excitement of going to a gay bar for the first time and the reality that sets in once he arrives. Jason was a ballet dancer during most of his teenage years and into his 20s. He was celebrated for being thin. During one of his first times at a gay bar, he was told he's too skinny and needed to put on some muscle, leading him down a path of taking testosterone and being unhappy. It wasn't until he realized he needed to be happy with who he was because &amp;amp;amp;quot;I wasnt happy pretending to be someone else.&amp;amp;amp;quot; Growing up in a religious household, Benjamine was concerned about having to come out to his mom not only as gay, but as the owner of the successful porn company CockyBoys and being in a polyamorous relationship with two other guys. What he learned from the experience was that honestly is the best thing in life. At 5 years old, Noah Michelson did a seductive dance in his underwear for the family's garbage man. After being called &amp;amp;amp;quot;queer&amp;amp;amp;quot;, Noah finally had a word to define who he was and how he felt. Renee has always been a tomboy, and now identifies as queer. When Renee was a teen, a neighborhood mom noticed how Renee dressed and took them (Renee uses &amp;amp;amp;quot;they/them/their&amp;amp;amp;quot; pronouns) to The Gap to buy them feminine-looking pants. The experience was traumatic, but also transformational. From wearing Catholic school uniforms in childhood to menswear at a global bank, Erika Miguel has been all over the spectrum of gender expression and fashion. An inappropriate encounter at her job, related to her gender expression, led her to find a new job. Tori Baker went from a rough childhood to drugs to having a daughter and turning her life around. The turning point was realizing that she &amp;amp;amp;quot;can be who I am and like the people that I like. Mitch was afraid that the relationship might end, but knew it was time to tell his girlfriend that he's transgender. Not only did she support him, they're relationship grew stronger and eventually got married/ Only a few months before a study abroad trip to Rome, Charlie had begun hormone therapy and completed top surgery. He was nervous--about the language barrier and about passing as a male--when he walked into a small barbershop in Rome. Coming out leads to some embarrassing questions from this young man's mom.</desc>

    <title>Political Animals</title>
    <desc>Political Animals celebrates the legendary civil rights victories of four trailblazing California state politicians: Carole Migden, Sheila Keuhl, Jackie Goldberg, and Christine Kehoe. Fierce and unrelenting, these courageous women toppled a partisan majority and emerged victors to pass historic legislation for social justice and LGBT+ equality. It was a hard fight  filled with vehemently heated debates and hateful insults hurled by opponents. Today, the message behind Political Animals is more important than ever as the current political theatre unfurls around the globe. These inspiring biographies further reveal the critical importance for public resistance at the local level to pressure lawmakers to enact difficult change. Political Animals is a clear call to action for a new era of greater democratic participation. We invite you to follow in the footsteps of these historic leaders and become the next pioneering political animal!</desc>

    <desc>Just about everybody likes animals and doesn't like to see animals who are sick, injured or abused. So "Animal Rescue," a weekly series -- aimed at children and families -- that showcases spectacular rescues of animals, should be very popular. Because people don't like to see an animal's situation get so bad that it requires rescue, the program tries to avoid those situations by instructing children on the proper care of animals, as well as giving safety tips on caring for all types of creatures.</desc>
